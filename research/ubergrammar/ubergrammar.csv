没 + 有<br>我没有钱 。		- Negation of 'you' with 'mei'<br>- The verb 有 (yǒu) is negated differently from ordinary verbs. Rather than placing 不 (bù) before it as with other verbs, you must use 没 (méi) to negate the verb 有 (yǒu).<br>- Nearly all verbs can benegated with 不 (bù). The verb 有 (yǒu) is an important exception to this rule, and must be negated with 没 (méi).<br>- 没 + 有 (+ Obj.)<br>- Note: because of the special relationship between 没 (méi) and 有 (yǒu), the pinyin for 没有 is normally written without a space: 'méiyǒu.'<br><ruby>我没有问题。<rt>Wǒ méiyǒu wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>I don't have any questions.<br><ruby>我们 现在没有钱。<rt>Wǒmen xiànzài méiyǒu qián.</rt></ruby><br>We don't have money now.<br><ruby>他没有工作 吗？<rt>Tā méiyǒu gōngzuò ma? </rt></ruby><br>Does he not have a job? <br><hr><br>- Remember that trying to negate 有 (yǒu) with 不 (bù) is a classic mistake that many people make in the early stages of studying Chinese:<br>- Never use 不 (bù) with 有 (yǒu).<br>- 没有 (méiyǒu) can be shortened to 没 (méi) without altering its meaning.<br><ruby>我没钱。<rt>Wǒ méi qián.</rt></ruby><br>I don't have money.<br><ruby>你没男朋友 吗？<rt> Nǐ méi nánpéngyou ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you not have a boyfriend?<br><ruby>你们没车 吗？<rt>Nǐmen méi chē ma?</rt></ruby><br>You don't have a car?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPNV3Q		{}
不 + Verb / Adj.<br>他们不是 坏 孩子。		- Standard negation with 'bu'<br>- 不 (bù) is generally used to negate averbin the present or future, or to talk about what you do not do, as a habit. So expressing things like 'I don't want to go' or 'I'm not going' or 'I don't eat meat' would be typical uses of 不 (bù).<br>- The standard way to negate verbs in Chinese is with 不 (bù). To negate a verb, simply place 不 (bù) before it:<br>- Subj. + 不 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>他们不是坏 孩子。<rt>Tāmen bù shì  huài háizi.</rt></ruby><br>They are not bad kids.<br><ruby>我们不喝酒。<rt>Wǒmen bù hējiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>We don't drink alcohol.<br><ruby>我 今天不想 工作。<rt>Wǒ jīntiān bù xiǎng gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>I don't want to work today.<br><hr><br>- Almost all verbs can be negated with 不 (bù) (unless you're talking about the past). The only verb that can never be negated with 不 (bù) is有 (yǒu).<br><hr><br>- As it turns out, the structure with anadjectiveis basically the same as the one with a verb.<br>- Subj. + 不 + Adj.<br><ruby>我不饿。<rt>Wǒ bù è.</rt></ruby><br>I'm not hungry.<br><ruby>这 个不贵。<rt>Zhège bù guì.</rt></ruby><br>This is not expensive.<br><ruby>公司不大。<rt>Gōngsī bù dà.</rt></ruby><br>The company is not big.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIPYFV		{}
都 + Verb / Adj.<br>我们都住 在 上海。		- The 'all' adverb 'dou'<br>- The adverb 都 (dōu) is used to express 'all' in Chinese. It's common to use 都 (dōu) in a variety of sentences where it would seem unnecessary in English.<br>- Subj. + 都 + [Verb Phrase]<br>- Remember that 都 (dōu) appearsafterthe subject. A common mistake learners make is to put 都 (dōu) at the beginning of the sentence (as 'all' often appears there in English). This isn't good Chinese - make sure you put 都 (dōu) after the subject and before the verb.<br><ruby>你们都认识 John 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen dōu rènshi John ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you all know John? <br><ruby>他们都在 上海 。<rt>Tāmen dōu zài Shànghǎi.</rt></ruby><br>They are all in Shanghai.<br><ruby>明天 我们都可以 去 。<rt>Míngtiān wǒmen dōu kěyǐ qù.</rt></ruby><br>Tomorrow we all can go.<br><hr><br>- Chinese doesn't normally use a special word for 'both' like English does.  It just uses 都 (dōu) as if it were any other number greater than one.  Chinese also doesn't have a special pattern like 'neither / nor' for the negative case.  Just use 都 (dōu) and make the sentence negative.<br>- Subj. + 都 + [Verb Phrase]<br>- This pattern should look familiar.<br>- These examples follow exactly the same form in Chinese as the ones above.  The only difference is that here we don't translate 都 (dōu) as 'all' in English; we translate it as 'both,' and for negative cases, we translate it as 'neither.'<br><ruby>我们 两 个都爱 你 。<rt>Wǒmen liǎng gè dōu ài nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>The two of us both love you.<br><ruby>你 爸爸 和 你 妈妈都是 美国人 吗？<rt> Nǐ bàba hé nǐ māma dōu shì Měiguó rén ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are your father and your mother both Americans? <br><ruby>我 和 我 太太都不 吃 肉。<rt>Wǒ hé wǒ tàitai dōu bù chī ròu.</rt></ruby><br>Neither my wife nor I eat meat.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9YK09		{}
也 + Verb / Adj.<br>昨天 很 冷，今天也很冷。		- The 'also' adverb 'ye'<br>- The English adverb 'too' or 'also' is expressed in Chinese as 也 (yě). In Chinese, italwaysneeds to come before the verb (or adjective).<br>- Since it is anadverb, 也 (yě) is inserted after the subject, before theverborverb phrase.<br>- Subj. + 也 + Verb / [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>我也喜欢。<rt> Wǒ yě xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>I also like it.<br><ruby>我也是 学生 。<rt> Wǒ yě shì xuésheng.</rt></ruby><br>I am a student too.<br><ruby>她也有 一个 儿子。<rt> Tā yě yǒu yī gè érzi.</rt></ruby><br>She also has a son.<br><hr><br>- Let's take one more look at two different English sentences which mean the same thing, but can result in bad Chinese if you translate word-for-word.<br><hr><br>- Note that the translation for the first sentence is 'I also like it.' The translation of the second sentence is 'I like it too,' which is equally correct in English, but translated word-for-word into Chinese, the 也 (yě) comes at the end of the sentence, which is100% wrongin Chinese.<br>- Please note that in English, we replace the word 'too' with 'either' in negative sentences.  For example:<br>- In Chinese, regardless of whether the sentence is positive ('I like themtoo') or negative ('Idon'tlike themeither'), 也 (yě) is used the same way.  Just make sure you put the 也 (yě)beforethe 不 (bù) or other negative part that comes before the verb.<br><ruby>我也不喜欢。<rt> Wǒ yě bù xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>I don't like it either.<br><ruby>我也不知道。<rt> Wǒ yě bù zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>I don't know either.<br><ruby>他也没有。<rt>Tā yě méiyǒu.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't have it either.<br><hr><br>- 也 (yě) can also be used with adjectives. Remember that forsimple 'noun + adjective' sentencesyou normally need to include an adverb like 很 (hěn) before the adjective. In that case, just put the 也 (yě) before the adverb.<br>- Subj. + 也 (+ Adv.) + Adj.<br><ruby>你也很高。<rt>Nǐ yě hěn gāo.</rt></ruby><br>You are also tall.<br><ruby>他也很胖。<rt> Tā yě hěn  pàng.</rt></ruby><br>He is also fat.<br><ruby>我 爸爸也很帅。<rt>Wǒ bàba yě hěn  shuài.</rt></ruby><br>My dad is also handsome.<br><hr><br>- It can be tricky to know how to say 'me too' when you first study 也 (yě), as you can't say 'wǒ yě' all by itself. That's not a complete sentence; you can't just leave 也 (yě) hanging there with nothing after it.<br>- The all-purpose correct sentence is 'wǒ yě shì,' which literally means, 'I am too,' but can also stand in for 'me too.'<br>- The correct structure uses the verb 是 (shì):<br>- The 'me too' structure works with other subjects, as well. But for these simple examples, we'll stick to the classic 我 (wǒ) subject.<br>- For this next one, you'll notice that the 'me too' reply repeats the original verb 喜欢 (xǐhuan) instead of using 是 (shì). Both ways are possible.<br>- You'll notice that some of those English translations use 'so do I.'  The Chinese works exactly the same; they're just translated that way to produce more natural-sounding English.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGG25MD		{}
Noun 1 + 和 + Noun 2<br>我和他 都 不 去。		- Expressing 'and' with 'he'<br>- When listing out multiple nouns, 和 (hé) is there to help you out. Just remember that 和 (hé) isn't a word you can use to translate justanyusage of the English word 'and.'<br>- The most common way to express 'and' in Chinese is with 和 (hé). It's important to note that 和 (hé)is mainly used to link nouns. This is how you should use itexclusivelyas you get used to it. Don't try to linkverbs(or whole sentences) with 和 (hé).<br>- Noun 1 + 和 + Noun 2<br><ruby>你和我<rt>nǐ hé wǒ</rt></ruby><br>you and I<br><ruby>老板 喜欢咖啡和茶。<rt>Lǎobǎn xǐhuan kāfēi hé chá.</rt></ruby><br>The boss likes coffee and tea.<br><ruby>我 的 爷爷和奶奶都 70 岁 。<rt>Wǒ de yéye hé  nǎinai dōu qīshí suì.</rt></ruby><br>My grandpa and grandma are both 70 years old.<br><hr><br>- (If you're unclear why the 都 (dōu) is used in the sentences above, see our article onthe adverb 都 (dōu).)<br>- Just to be absolutely clear what we mean by using 和 (hé) with nouns only, here are two English examples of what you should and shouldn't try to express with 和 (hé):	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGP0KFF		{}
A + 还是 + B ?<br>你 要 喝 茶还是咖啡 ?		- Offering choices with 'haishi'<br>- 还是 (háishì) is used in Chinese to provide options in aquestion. This is equivalent to one of our uses of 'or' in English.<br>- Option A + 还是 + Option B ?<br>- When you're asked a question of this form, there are two ways you're expected to answer: either Option A or Option B.  (Pick one, but not both.)  It's not that no other answers are possible, it's that usually when you're asked a question this way, the person asking expects you to just choose one.  For example, if asked if you'd like to drink coffee or tea, most people are going to choose one or the other, not ask for both. 还是 (háishì) is used to ask people to make that choice between the two.<br>- You can take the structure above, add a subject and a verb, and create all kinds of questions with the following structure:<br>- Subj. + Verb + Option A + 还是 + Option B ?<br><ruby>这 是水还是酒？<rt>Zhè shì shuǐ  háishì jiǔ?</rt></ruby><br>Is this water or alcohol?<br><ruby>他 是美国 人还是英国 人？<rt>Tā shì Měiguó rén  háishì Yīngguó rén?</rt></ruby><br>Is he American or British?<br><ruby>你 喜欢我还是我 的 钱？<rt>Nǐ xǐhuan wǒ  háishì wǒ de qián?</rt></ruby><br>Do you like me or my money?<br><hr><br>- Please note that 还是 (háishì) is for offering options in aquestion.  It should not be used for'or' in statements.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGA8NIB		{}
Subj. + Number + 岁<br>我 20岁。		- Age with 'sui'<br>- Use 岁 (suì) to give a person's age, similar to how we say 'years old' in English. There are a details that work differently from English, however.<br>- The structure for telling someone's age with 岁 (suì) is:<br>- Subj. + Number + 岁<br>- This is equivalent to someone 'isx years old' in English. Notice that you don't need to include any verb when you use 岁 (suì).<br><ruby>我 20岁。<rt>Wǒ èrshí suì.</rt></ruby><br>I am 20 years old.<br><ruby>我 儿子 一岁。<rt>Wǒ érzi yī suì.</rt></ruby><br>My son is one year old.<br><ruby>我 妈妈 今年 45岁。<rt>Wǒ māma jīnnián sìshí-wǔ suì.</rt></ruby><br>My mother is 45 years old this year.<br><hr><br>- Note that you shouldn't use either the verb是(shì) or themeasure wordlike个(gè)  in any of these sentences.<br><hr><br>- The word for 'half' in Chinese is 半 (bàn), and you simply add this after 岁 (suì).<br>- Subj. + Number + 岁 + 半<br><ruby>她两岁半。<rt>Tā liǎng suì bàn.</rt></ruby><br>She is two and a half years old.<br><ruby>我 儿子 一岁半。<rt>Wǒ érzi yī suì bàn.</rt></ruby><br>My son is one and a half years old.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQUKJF		{}
Number + 个 + Noun<br>一个人 。		- Measure word 'ge'<br>- 个 (gè) is the most commonly usedmeasure word. It can be used in a pinch for any noun if you can't think of a more precise measure word. (Although you might not sound quite as smart, you'll still get your point across). Also, for many nouns, 个 (gè)isthe only correct measure word.<br>- The general structure for 个 (gè) and measure words in general is:<br>- Number + 个 + Noun<br>- Any time you want to statehow manyof a noun in Chinese, you probably need a measure word.  First get used to how they are used with 个 (gè).<br>- Verb + 个 + Noun<br>- If the number is one (1), you can omit it and use 个 (gè) by itself. This is similar to 'a' or 'an' in English, for example in 'a person' or 'an idiot.' (The tone on 个 (gè) is normally somewhat de-emphasized in this usage, but still written as fourth tone. You don't need to stress about it, though.)<br><ruby>他 是个老外。<rt>Tā shì gè lǎowài.</rt></ruby><br>He is a foreigner.<br><ruby>我 有个儿子。<rt>Wǒ yǒu gè érzi.</rt></ruby><br>I have a son.<br><ruby>她 是个好 老师。<rt>Tā shì gè hǎo lǎoshī.</rt></ruby><br>She is a good teacher.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGI0T9S		{}
Number + 年 + Number + 月 + Number + 日<br>今天 是2011年 11月 11日/号。		- Structure of dates<br>- Dates in Chinese follow the order 'year, month, day.' This is in keeping with the 'from big to small' trend which pervades many facets of Chinese culture.<br>- Dates are arranged from largest unit to smallest:year, month, day.<br>- x 年 + y 月 + z 日<br>- So April 1st, 2019 is2019年4月1日 (èr-líng-yī-jiǔniánSìyuèyīrì).<br>- Note that 号 (hào) is commonly used inspokenMandarin instead of 日 (rì):<br>- x 年 + y 月 + z 号<br>- The above example becomes:2019年4月1号 (èr-líng-yī-jiǔniánSìyuèyīhào). In written Chinese, however, you will see 日 (rì) rather than 号 (hào).<br><ruby>1868年1月18号<rt>Yī-bā-liù-bā nián Yīyuè shíbā hào</rt></ruby><br>January 18, 1868<br><ruby>1910年8月9号<rt>Yī-jiǔ-yī-líng nián Bāyuè jiǔ hào</rt></ruby><br>August 9, 1910<br><ruby>2001年7月20日<rt>èr-líng-líng-yī nián Qīyuè èrshí rì</rt></ruby><br>July 20th, 2001<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGT3KF6		{}
星期 + Number<br>今天星期三。		- Structure of days of the week<br>- 星期 (xīngqī) means 'week' in Chinese. This is also used to indicate which weekday you are talking about.<br>- Days of the week in Chinese are formed by the word 'week' followed by a number:<br>- Notice that Sunday is the only exception. Rather than a number, 天 (tiān) is used. More formally, Sunday is also referred to as 星期日 (Xīngqīrì).<br>- One other implication of this system that you may not have noticed: 'day one' is Monday. In Chinese culture, the first day of the week is Monday, andnotSunday.<br>- Hopefully this doesn't freak you out, but there are actually two other ways to say 'week' in Chinese. You should still learn 星期 (xīngqī) first, and that's really all you need as a beginner.<br>- The other words for 'week' are 礼拜 (lǐbài) and 周 (zhōu). Skip them for now unless you really need them.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVH4Q5		{}
Number + Unit<br>三 百 五 十 九。		- Structure of numbers<br>- Chinese handles numbers in a very consistent and logical way. Once you've mastered just a few tricky parts, you will know how to read out any number in Chinese.<br>- You just have to memorize these ten; nothing tricky there.<br>- Like in American English, Chinese phone numbers are given as a string of individual numbers, using the digits 0-9. The only trick is that the number 1 is often pronounced 'yāo' instead of 'yī' to avoid confusion with number 7, which is pronounced 'qī.'<br>- 十 + x<br>- Eleven, twelve and the teens are handled very logically. They're formed with 十 (shí) followed by a digit 一  (yī) to 九 (jiǔ). So eleven is 十一 (shíyī), twelve is 十二 (shí'èr), thirteen is 十三 (shísān), and so on up to nineteen, which is 十九 (shíjiǔ).<br>- All the tens are also formed very logically. Twenty is 二十 (èrshí), thirty is 三十 (sānshí), and so on. Units in the tens are simply added on the end. So twenty one is 二十一 (èrshí-yī), thirty four is 三十四 (sānshí-sì), and ninety-nine is 九十九 (jiǔshí-jiǔ). All very logical and consistent.<br>- x + 十<br>- x + 十 + y<br>- And one hundred is simply 一百 (yībǎi), as in English. So you now know how to count to one hundred in Chinese.<br>- Note: when there's a '0' in the middle of a number, you read it as 零 (líng), and don't put a unit (like 'ten' or 'hundred') after it. In the following examples, we'll show what happens when the 'tens' place is a zero in a three-digit number.<br>- x + 百 + 零 + y<br>- For numbers greater than 100, if the number ends in zero (110, 230, 370, 450, etc.), a number like 150 can be read as 一百五十 (yībǎi wǔshí), but is often read as 一百五 (yībǎi wǔ). In fact, reading it as 一百五 (yībǎi wǔ)alwaysmeans 150, never 105. As described above, 105 would be read as 一百零五 (yībǎi líng wǔ).<br>- For numbers greater than 100 that end in a number in the teens, it's normal to pronounce the ten as 'yīshí' rather than just 'shí' (see the examples below).<br>- Also, sometimes the number '200' is read as 二百 (èrbǎi), but often it is read as 两百 (liǎngbǎi). Both are OK. (This is an二 (èr) vs. 两 (liǎng) issuewhich you may or may not have encountered before.)<br>- x + 百 + y + 十 + z<br>- 千 (qiān) means 'thousand' in Chinese. Its rules of usage are similar to the rules for 'hundred.' Just note that no matter how many zeroes are in the middle of the number, you just say 零 (líng) once.<br>- Things get a little trickier once you get to 10,000. If you're ready for it, you can move on tobig numbers.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCRH6P		{}
Number + 点(钟)<br>现在十一点。		- Structure of times (basic)<br>- Time in Chinese, just like in English, is expressed by stating the hour first, and then the minute (big to small).<br>- The time of day in Chinese is formed with anumber1 to 12 (一 (yī) to 十二 (shí'èr)) followed by 点 (diăn). This 点 (diăn) is equivalent too'clockin English. In China, people generally use a twelve-hour clock, preceded by 上午 (shàngwŭ) for 'a.m.' or 下午 (xiàwŭ) for 'p.m.' when necessary.<br>- (Date and/or time of day +) x 点<br>- Sometimes people use the longer 点钟 (diǎnzhōng) instead of just 点 (diǎn), but you're fine using the short form.<br>- If you want to include more specific information, start with the day or date, followed by the general time of day, with the exact clock time last. (This is the big-to-small pattern.) This is how Chinese gets around the need for 'a.m.' or 'p.m.': use 上午 (shàngwǔ) for times in the morning, and 下午 (xiàwǔ) for times in the afternoon.<br><ruby>九点<rt>jiǔ diǎn</rt></ruby><br>9 o'clock<br><ruby>上午 七点<rt>shàngwǔ qī diǎn</rt></ruby><br>7 o'clock a.m.<br><ruby>下午 四点<rt>xiàwǔ sì diǎn</rt></ruby><br>4 o'clock p.m.<br><hr><br>- Note thattwo o'clock is 两点(liǎng diǎn), not 二点 (èr diǎn). (For more information on when to use 两 (liǎng) vs. 二 (èr), see our article oncomparing 'er' and 'liang').<br>- 'Twelveo'clock,' however, is still 十二点 (shí'èr diǎn).<br>- Half hours are added after 点 (diăn) and are indicated with 半 (bàn).<br>- x 点 + 半<br><ruby>五点 半<rt>wǔ diǎn bàn</rt></ruby><br>5:30<br><ruby>下午 两点 半<rt>xiàwǔ liǎng diǎn bàn</rt></ruby><br>2:30 p.m.<br><ruby>星期天 上午 十点 半<rt>Xīngqītiān shàngwǔ shí diǎn bàn</rt></ruby><br> Sunday at 10:30 a.m.<br><hr><br>- As a beginner, that should be all you need. If you've mastered all of these structures and want to get a little more advanced, seestructure of times (advanced).<br>- Simple times with 点 (diăn) is on HSK1, but the usage above with 半 (bàn) is not. It is not tested until HSK3.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGN6BBU		{}
Pronoun + Noun<br>我 女朋友		- Expressing close possession without 'de'<br>- Expressing possessionin Chinese is accomplished with the particle的(de). But sometimes when certain (especially close) relationships are involved, it's more natural to drop the 的 (de).<br>- Pronoun + Noun<br>- Normallypossessionis expressed using theparticle的 (de). However, you can omit 的 (de) in these cases:<br>- In these cases 的 (de)should beomitted. It doesn't sound as natural if you leave it in.<br><ruby>我 家很 大。<rt>Wǒ jiā hěn dà.</rt></ruby><br>My house is very big.<br><ruby>你 哥哥很 高 。<rt> Nǐ gēge hěn gāo.</rt></ruby><br>Your big brother is very tall.<br><ruby>这 是我 女朋友。<rt>Zhè shì wǒ nǚpéngyou.</rt></ruby><br>This is my girlfriend.<br><hr><br>- If 的 (de) was used in the above examples, it would create an unnatural sense of distance between the two.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCI0KG		{}
Noun 1 + 的 + Noun 2<br>我 的老师		- Expressing possession with 'de'<br>- In Chinese, possession is marked with the particle 的 (de), placed after the 'owner' noun or noun phrase. This particle works in a similar way to apostrophe-'s' in English, but is used much more broadly in Chinese. This article highlights one of its simplest and most common usages.<br>- Noun 1 + 的 + Noun 2<br>- This means 'Noun 1's Noun 2' (where Noun 2 belongs to Noun 1).<br>- The structure is super simple.  It will take a bit of time before you realize how truly universal this pattern is.  It doesn't matter whether the 'Noun 1' is a person, place, or thing, or even if it's a pronoun (like 'he,' 'she,' or 'it').  The structure stays consistent.<br><ruby>我的老师<rt>wǒ de lǎoshī</rt></ruby><br>my teacher<br><ruby>你的手机<rt>nǐ de  shǒujī </rt></ruby><br>your cell phone<br><ruby>我们的钱<rt>wǒmen de qián</rt></ruby><br>our money<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGUHQD2		{}
⋯⋯呢 ?<br>我 很 好。你呢?		- Questions with 'ne'<br>- The particle 呢 (ne) can be used to ask reciprocal questions, also known as 'bounce back' questions. 呢 (ne) can also be used to form simple questions asking 'what about...?' or 'how about...?'<br>- Topic + 呢 ？<br>- And it's as simple as that. Say what you want to ask about, then stick 呢 (ne) on the end. A very common way to use this is to return a question after being asked it. The classic example is this exchange:<br>- More 呢 (ne) examples (each of these can be translated as a 'what about' question):<br><ruby>这 个 很 好 ， 那 个呢？<rt>Zhège hěn hǎo, nàge ne?</rt></ruby><br>This one is good. What about that one?<br><ruby>这 个 用 中文 怎么 说？那 个呢？<rt>Zhège yòng Zhōngwén zěnme shuō? Nàge ne?</rt></ruby><br>How do I say this in Chinese? And that?<br><ruby>我 在 家，你呢？<rt>Wǒ zài jiā. Nǐ ne?</rt></ruby><br>I'm at home. What about you?<br><hr><br>- You'll occasionally hear someone seemingly using 呢 (ne) out of the blue. When this happens, they're usually askingwheresomeone or something is, and they expect that you know what they're talking about and know where that person or thing is.<br>- [Missing Person / Thing] + 呢 ？<br>- This one is simple, so just a few examples are needed:<br><ruby>钱呢？<rt>Qián ne?</rt></ruby><br>Where's the money?<br><ruby>你 妈妈呢？<rt>Nǐ māma ne?</rt></ruby><br>Where's your mom?<br><ruby>我 的 手机呢？<rt>Wǒ de shǒujī ne?</rt></ruby><br>Where's my cell phone?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMJHZO		{}
Command + 吧<br>我们 走吧。		- Suggestions with 'ba'<br>- The particle 吧 (ba) hasa number of different uses. Here we'll talk about the simplest way to use 吧 (ba): making suggestions.<br>- Command + 吧<br>- Note that in Chinese, whenever you have a command with the subject 'we,' you're basically just saying, 'let's(do something).'   吧 (ba) just makes the suggestion sound more tentative and more polite.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMPZ6D		{}
在 + Place<br>老师在 上海。		- Expressing existence in a place with 'zai'<br>- The verb 在 (zài) expresses existence in a location, similar to how we say in English, 'to be at' or 'to be in.'<br>- The verb 在 (zài) is used to express existence in a place. English does not have a verb exclusively for this purpose, and instead uses 'to be' with apreposition. In Chinese, 在 (zài) can cover both of these roles.<br>- Subj. + 在 + Place<br>- Remember that you don't need another verb in this construction. It can be tempting to try use 是 (shì), as English uses 'to be,' but this is not correct. 在 (zài) is the only verb needed.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLRWT8		{}
Place + 有 + Obj.<br>我们 学校有很 多 学生。		- Expressing existence with 'you'<br>- The verb 有 (yǒu), which means 'to have,' can also be used to express existence. This is similar to saying 'there is' or 'there are' in English.<br>- Literally, this structure expresses that a place 'has' a thing, which is to say, that thing is in the place.<br>- Place + 有 + Obj.<br><ruby>我 家有很 多 小 狗。<rt>Wǒ jiā yǒu hěn duō xiǎo gǒu.</rt></ruby><br>There are a lot of puppies in my home.<br><ruby>我们 学校有很 多 帅哥 。<rt>Wǒmen xuéxiào yǒu hěn duō shuàigē.</rt></ruby><br>There are a lot of cute guys in our school.<br><ruby>日本有很 多 中国人。<rt>Rìběn yǒu hěn duō Zhōngguó rén.</rt></ruby><br>There are many Chinese people in Japan.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG04ZCI		{}
Subj. + 有 + Obj.<br>我有钱。		- Expressing possession with 'you'<br>- 有 (yǒu)can be used in various ways, but the most basic meaning of thisverbyou need to know is 'to have.'<br>- Subj. + 有 + Obj.<br><ruby>我有钱。<rt>Wǒ yǒu qián.</rt></ruby><br>I have money.<br><ruby>你有房子 吗？<rt>Nǐ yǒu fángzi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you have a house?<br><ruby>她 没有车。<rt>Tā méi yǒu chē.</rt></ruby><br>She doesn't have a car.<br><hr><br>- The verb 有 (yǒu) is negated in a special way. Unlike most verbs, it is negated with 没 (méi) instead of 不 (bù). The negative form of 有 (yǒu) then, is 没有 (méiyǒu). For more on that topic, see our article onnegation of 'you' with 'mei.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGOOCVO		{}
叫 + Name<br>你叫什么 名字 ？		- Using the verb 'jiao'<br>- The verb 叫 (jiào) is used to indicate what someone or something is called, or what someone or something's name is. Its usage can seem a little weird to beginners, so it gets its own grammar point.<br>- The verb 叫 (jiào) means both 'to call' and 'to be called.' It's an easy way to give names, using the following structure:<br>- Subj. + 叫 + [Name]<br>- This can be used to give your full name or just your first name.<br>- You can also ask people their names using 叫 (jiào):<br><ruby>你叫什么 名字 ？<rt>Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?</rt></ruby><br>What's your name? <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGUGWVZ		{}
去 + Place<br>我去学校。		- Using the verb 'qu'<br>- You can use 去 (qù) whenever you have somewhere to go. It's pretty easy to get a handle on this verb; the only trick is getting used to not needing a word for 'to' before the destination.<br>- The verb 去 (qù) means 'to go,' and is an easy way to talk about going to places.<br>- Subj. + 去 + [Place]<br>- Notice that you don't need a word to express 'to.'<br>- You can also use 去 (qù) forasking questions. (Note the use of question words and question particles.)<br>- When answering a yes-no question that uses 去 (qù) you don't need anything following it. However, it's important to note that you cannot just use 去 (qù) when there is no context.<br>- Instead of a place, 去 (qù) can also be followed by some sort of action. The structure then means 'go to do (something),' and 'go and do (something).'<br>- Subj. + 去 + Verb<br><ruby>我去工作 。<rt>Wǒ qù gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>I'm going to work.<br><ruby>他去上课 。<rt>Tā qù shàngkè.</rt></ruby><br>He's going to class.<br><ruby>你 想去旅行 吗？<rt>Nǐ xiǎng qù lǚxíng ma?</rt></ruby><br>Would you like to go travel?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGFYNCL		{}
姓 + Surname<br>你姓什么 ？		- Using the verb 'xing'<br>- The verb 姓 (xìng) literally means 'to be surnamed' or 'to have the surname.' It may seem awkward at first that there's a verb just for this, but you'll find that it's used quite often in Chinese.<br>- 姓 (xìng) is used most often to tell someone your own surname ('family name' or 'last name'), or to ask the surname of someone else.<br>- Subj. + 姓 + [Surname]<br><ruby>我姓王。<rt>Wǒ xìng Wáng.</rt></ruby><br>My family name is Wang.<br><ruby>你 老板姓李 吗？<rt> Nǐ lǎobǎn xìng Lǐ ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is your boss's last name Li?<br><ruby>那 个 帅哥姓张。<rt>Nàge shuàigē xìng Zhāng.</rt></ruby><br>That handsome guy's last name is Zhang.<br><hr><br>- You can also use 姓 (xìng) to ask people their surnames. You could do this quite directly by saying:<br><ruby>你 姓 什么?<rt>Nǐ xìng shénme?</rt></ruby><br>What is your last name?<br><hr><br>- However, the formal way to ask has a set form:<br><ruby>您 贵 姓 ？<rt>Nín guì xìng?</rt></ruby><br>What is your honorable surname?<br><hr><br>- Literally this means 'What is your honorable surname?' Use this form to be polite when asking people their surnames.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPS9NY		{}
能 + Verb<br>中文 这么 难，你能学 好 吗？		- Expressing ability or possibility with 'neng'<br>- 能 (néng) is one of several Chinese words that is normally translated as 'can' in English. However, 能 (néng) is used to emphasize one's ability or the possibility of something happening.<br>- 能 (néng) indicates ability when used with activities that are not consciously learned or studied.<br>- The structure to use 能 (néng) to express 'ability' is:<br>- Subj. + 能 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>我能吃 四 十 个 饺子。<rt>Wǒ néng chī sìshí gè jiǎozi.</rt></ruby><br>I can eat 40 dumplings.<br><ruby>他能工作 24 个 小时。<rt>Tā néng gōngzuò èrshí-sì gè xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br>He can work 24 hours.<br><ruby>你能帮 我 找到 他 吗？<rt>Nǐ néng bāng wǒ zhǎodào tā ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you help me find him?<br><hr><br>- When used with activities that are consciously learned or studied, 能 (néng) generally means that circumstances do not allow execution of the action.  In other words, it'snot possible.<br>- The structure to use 能 (néng) to express possibility is exactly the same:<br>- Subj. + 能 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>开车 一 个 小时能到 家 吗？<rt>Kāichē yī gè xiǎoshí néng dào jiā ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is it possible to drive home in one hour?<br><ruby>他们 明天能早 点 来 吗？<rt> Tāmen míngtiān néng zǎo diǎn lái ma?</rt></ruby><br>Would it be possible for them to come a little earlier tomorrow?<br><ruby>你们能小声 一点 吗？<rt>Nǐmen néng xiǎo shēng yīdiǎn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Could you all lower your voices a bit?<br><hr><br>- From these examples we can see such circumstances might be pertaining to getting someone's consent or reliant on the speaker's health. If the speaker wishes to express that they are able to execute an action requiring a consciously studied skill, 会 (huì) can be used instead.<br>- Because 能 (néng) can express possibility, it is often used to form polite questions, something like 'would it be possible' in English:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9PQ40		{}
会 + Verb<br>他会 说中文 。		- Expressing a learned skill with 'hui'<br>- The word 会 (huì) can be used to express an ability that has been learned (a skill). In this case 会 (huì) is anauxiliary verb.<br>- Subj. + 会 + Verb + Obj.<br>- This structure is the easiest way to express all kinds of skills, from languages, to sports, to skills in daily life such as cooking and driving.<br><ruby>他会说 中文。<rt>Tā huì shuō Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>He can speak Chinese.<br><ruby>我会写 汉字。<rt>Wǒ huì xiě Hànzì.</rt></ruby><br>I can write Chinese characters.<br><ruby>你会做饭 吗？<rt>Nǐ huì zuòfàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you cook food？<br><hr><br>- 会 (huì) sentences arenegated with 不 (bù), which is inserted in front of 会 (huì):<br>- Subj. + 不 + 会 + Verb + Obj.<br>- Again, this is the simplest way to express the lack of a learned ability. So while 'can't' is a natural translation for '不会' (bù huì) in English, 'don't know how to' is equally correct (and perhaps more helpful).<br>- Also, due to atone change rulefor '不' (bù), the phrase '不会' (bù huì) is actually pronounced 'bú huì.'<br><ruby>我不会说 英文。<rt> Wǒ bù huì shuō Yīngwén.</rt></ruby><br>I can't speak English.<br><ruby>妈妈不会做 中国 菜。<rt>Māma bù huì zuò Zhōngguó cài.</rt></ruby><br>Mom can't cook Chinese food.<br><ruby>你不会游泳 吗？<rt> Nǐ bù huì yóuyǒng ma?</rt></ruby><br>You can't swim?<br><hr><br>- Note that if we say 我不能说中文 (wǒ bù néng shuō Zhōngwén), the speaker is saying that he can't speak Chinesefor some reason other than his own ability, perhaps because speaking Chinese in English class is forbidden.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGRHM0E		{}
Subj. + 要 + Verb (+ 了)<br>我要去 吃饭，你 去 吗？		- Expressing 'be going to' with 'yao'<br>- Theauxiliary verb要 (yào) hasseveral different meanings, and here we'll tackle the 'be going to' meaning. You'll use this when you are discussing your plans with someone.<br>- The idea behind this usage of 要 (yào) is that someone is 'planning to' or 'going to' or 'preparing to' do something.  It's not that they justwant to, orhave to, it's that they fully expect to do it.  It's in their plan.<br>- This usage of 要 (yào) typically includes atime wordof some sort, which may be placed before or after the subject. This is fairly logical; if you're discussing plans for the future, you're quite likely to say when you plan to do things.<br>- Subj. + Time + 要 + Verb<br>- Time + Subj. + 要 + Verb<br>- Note that the time word is not strictly required, and when it's missing, you may at first find yourself wonderingwhich usage of 要 (yào)you're dealing with. This is normal; it just takes some getting used to.<br><ruby>我明天要买 一 个  iPhone。<rt>Wǒ míngtiān yào mǎi yī gè iPhone.</rt></ruby><br>I am going to buy an iPhone tomorrow.<br><ruby>你们现在要出去 吗？<rt>Nǐmen xiànzài yào chūqù ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you all going out now?<br><ruby>我们今年要去 美国 。<rt>Wǒmen jīnnián yào qù Měiguó.</rt></ruby><br>We are planning to go to the U.S. this year.<br><hr><br>- {{Source|Chinese Grammar - Broken down into 100 items - Basic and Intermediate Levels (汉语语法百项讲练 - 初中级)]]→buy	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVT2KN		{}
可以 + Verb<br>这里可以吸烟 吗?		- Expressing permission with 'keyi'<br>- 可以 (kěyǐ) is anauxiliary verbprimarily used for expressing permission. It's often translated as 'can,' but in order to not get it confused with other words, it's best to think of it as 'may' to emphasize thepermissionaspect.<br>- Just put 可以 (kěyǐ) in directly before averbto create a meaning of 'may' (plus the verb). It's the same structure whether it's a statement or a question.<br>- Subj. + 可以 + Verb + Obj.<br>- Use this structure to express permission to do things.<br><ruby>我可以进来 吗？<rt>Wǒ kěyǐ jìnlái ma?</rt></ruby><br>May I come in?<br><ruby>二十 一 岁 以后可以喝酒。<rt>Èrshí-yī suì yǐhòu kěyǐ hējiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>After you are 21 years old, you may drink alcohol.<br><ruby>妈妈，我可以出去 玩 吗？<rt>Māma, wǒ kěyǐ chūqù wán ma?</rt></ruby><br>Mom, may I go out and play?<br><hr><br>- 可以 (kěyǐ) sentences arenegated with 不 (bù), which is inserted before 可以 (kěyǐ).<br>- Subj. + 不 + 可以 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>孩子不 可以看 这 个。<rt>Háizi bù kěyǐ kàn zhège.</rt></ruby><br>Children can't watch this.<br><ruby>你 现在不 可以进去。<rt>Nǐ xiànzài bù kěyǐ jìnqù.</rt></ruby><br>You can't go in right now.<br><ruby>这里不 可以抽烟。<rt>Zhèlǐ  bù kěyǐ chōuyān.</rt></ruby><br>You can't smoke here.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6SPYK		{}
要 + Verb<br>我要吃饭 。		- Wanting to do something with 'yao'<br>- Theauxiliary verb要 (yào) hasseveral different meanings, and here we'll tackle the 'want to' meaning. To express 'wanting to do' something, use 要 (yào) before the verb.<br>- The verb 要 (yào) can be used as anauxiliary verbto indicatewanting to dosomething.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>他要学 中文。<rt>Tā yào xué Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>He wants to study Chinese.<br><ruby>宝宝要睡觉。<rt>Bǎobao yào shuìjiào.</rt></ruby><br>The baby wants to sleep.<br><ruby>早饭 我要吃 肉。<rt>Zǎofàn wǒ yào chī ròu.</rt></ruby><br>For breakfast I want to eat meat.<br><hr><br>- Instead of using 要 (yào), it is also possible to use the word 想 (xiǎng). These two words are largely interchangeable, and both can mean 'to want.' The small difference is that 要 (yào) is often used for something you want to orneedto do, andplan to take action on. It can sound a bit more demanding (and less polite). 想 (xiǎng) on the other hand, often conveys an idea on one's mind, that onemay or may not take action on. You can think of it as meaning 'would like to.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGXVEAR		{}
怎么 + Verb ?<br>怎么走?		- How to do something with 'zenme'<br>- 怎么 (zěnme) means 'how' in Chinese, and it's not hard to use at all: just put it before averb.<br>- The question word 怎么 (zěnme) is used to askhowin Chinese. It is inserted in front of the verb that's being asked about:<br>- Subj. + 怎么 + Verb + Obj.<br>- Note that the subject can often be omitted from general 'how to' questions, and there doesn't always have to be an object.<br><ruby>你们怎么学 中文？<rt>Nǐmen zěnme xué Zhōngwén?</rt></ruby><br>How do you study Chinese?<br><ruby>你怎么上班？坐 地铁 吗？<rt>Nǐ zěnme shàngbān?

By metro?<br><ruby>你 知道怎么去 外滩 吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào zěnme qù​ Wàitān ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know how to get to the Bund?<br><hr><br>- Starting a 'how to' question with thetopicat the beginning of the question is very common. That is, the thing being asked about is introduced first, then a question is asked about how to do something involving it.<br>- Topic + 怎么 + Verb<br>- The object doesn't have to come after the verb.  Sometimes it moves to the front of the question, establishing what the question is going to be about, before getting specific with the 'how' question.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGH2MNO		{}
没有 + Verb<br>我没有去 酒吧。		- Negation of past actions with 'meiyou'<br>- Use 没有 (méiyǒu) to negate past actions (to say that someonedidn't dosomething, or somethingdidn't happen).<br>- Usually verbs can benegated with 不 (bù), but that construction is used for habitual or present actions. If the verb is about an actionin the past, though, 没有 (méiyǒu) should be used:<br>- Subj. + 没有 / 没 + Verb<br>- Note that you can shorten 没有 (méiyǒu) to just 没 (méi).<br>- One thing you need to remember when using 没有 (méiyǒu) is that了 (le) is not normally used with 没有 (méiyǒu).了 (le)marks completed actions, while 没有 (méiyǒu) is used for actions thatdidn't happen(so of course they're not completed). These two don't work together. This is a very common mistake for beginner learners of Chinese.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGAUCXK		{}
不要 + Verb<br>不要说 英文！		- Negative commands with 'buyao'<br>- You can use 不要 (bùyào) to command someone: 'don't' (do something). This is similar to the other negative command '别 (bié).'<br>- Note:The pinyin for 不要 is written 'bùyào' but pronounced 'búyào' due to atone change rule.<br>- Negative commands in Chinese ('do not' or 'don't') are formed with 不要. Usually the subject is omitted, as in English.<br>- 不要 + Verb<br><ruby>不要走。<rt>Bùyào zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>Don't leave.<br><ruby>不要打 我！<rt>Bùyào dǎ wǒ!</rt></ruby><br>Don't hit me!<br><ruby>不要生气 ， 好吗 ？<rt>Bùyào shēngqì, hǎo ma?</rt></ruby><br>Don't get angry, OK?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIVZJU		{}
Subj. + Verb (+ Obj.)<br>我 爱 你 。		- Basic sentence order<br>- In its most basic form, Chineseword orderis very similar to English word order. These similarities definitely have their limits, though; don't expect the two languages' word orders to stay consistent much beyond the very basic sentence orders outlined below.<br>- A simplepredicatecan be just a verb. The most basic word order in Chinese is:<br>- Subj. + Verb<br>- You can form very simple sentences with just two words.<br>- A slightly longerpredicatemight be a verb with an object. A sentence with both a verb and an object is formed with this structure:<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj.<br>- This is the same as in English, and is commonly referred to as SVO word order. You can express a huge variety of things with this simple structure.<br>- Despite the convenient word order similarities highlighted above, things start to break down as soon as you start adding in such simple sentence elements asthe 'also' adverb 也 (yě),a time word, ora location where something happened.<br>- We have a video about that:<br>- Don't worry; the more complicated Chinese structures aren't hard, they're just different! (If Chinese word order were really the same as English word order, that would be just a little too convenient, wouldn't it?)	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGETNCO		{}
A + 是 + B<br>我是学生 。		- Connecting nouns with 'shi'<br>- The verbto beis not used in Chinese the same way as it is in English. In Chinese, 是 (shì) is for connectingnouns, and is generally not used withadjectives.<br>- The structure for connecting nouns with 是 (shì) is:<br>- Noun 1 + 是 + Noun 2<br>- This is equivalent to 'Noun 1isNoun 2' in English.<br>- Chinese does notconjugateverbs. That is, the form of the verb is the same no matter who is doing it. In this case, it is always 是 (shì) and never changes. As you can see, it's easy to form simple sentences expressingto bein Chinese. The only tricky thing about 是 (shì) in Chinese is that it's used to linktwo nouns, so you can't rely too much on translating directly from English when it comes to expressing the English verb 'to be' in Chinese.<br><ruby>我是学生。<rt>Wǒ shì xuésheng.</rt></ruby><br>I am a student.<br><ruby>你是John 吗？<rt>Nǐ shì John ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you John?<br><ruby>他们是有钱 人。<rt>Tāmen shì yǒuqián rén.</rt></ruby><br>They are rich people.<br><hr><br>- Be careful and take note. As you can see above, 是 (shì) is only used to link two nouns. It cannot be used to link a noun and an adjective. This is a very common mistake for people just beginning to learn Chinese. For that kind of sentence, you'll want to use a different structure withthe linking word 很 (hěn).<br>- In Chinese it is also possible to use the phrase '是不是 (shì bu shì)?' It can be used at the beginning or end of a sentence. It's meaning is quite similar to the English expressions 'right' and 'aren't you?' This is very useful if you want to express concern for a person, or if you want to mix up your sentence structure a bit and make it more interesting. The 是不是 (shì bu shì) pattern is also part ofaffirmative-negative questions.<br>- Another way to use 是 (shì) is touse it as a tag question. You can add “是吗?” (shì ma?) to the end of a question to mean the English equivalent of: 'is it' or 'yeah?' Using this in a question usually allows the speaker to get a confirmation answer.<br><ruby>他 没 听到，是 不 是？<rt>Tā méi tīngdào, shì bu shì?</rt></ruby><br>He didn't hear you, right?<br><ruby>你是 不 是还 没 吃饭？<rt>Nǐ shì bu shì hái méi chīfàn?</rt></ruby><br> Haven't you eaten yet?<br><ruby>你们是 不 是中 国 人？<rt>Nǐmen shì bu shì Zhōngguó rén?</rt></ruby><br> Are you Chinese?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGUN7RX		{}
太 + Adj. + 了<br>太好了!		- Expressing 'excessively' with 'tai'<br>- In Chinese, the simplest structure for expressing 'too' in the sense of 'excessively' is by using the word 太 (tài). Don't forget to also add 了 (le) after the adjective to keep your Chinese sounding natural.<br>- 太 + Adj. + 了<br>- As in English, this can express that something really is excessive (often as a complaint), or can also colloquially express the meaning of 'so' or 'very.'<br>- The following examples sound a little bit like a complaint, or a reason for not doing something. They're similar to how we would use 'too' in English, and the translations are straightforward.<br><ruby>米饭太多了。<rt>Mǐfàn tài duō le.</rt></ruby><br>There is too much rice.<br><ruby>现在太晚了。<rt>Xiànzài tài wǎn le.</rt></ruby><br>Now it's too late.<br><ruby>老板太忙了。<rt>Lǎobǎn tài máng le.</rt></ruby><br>The boss is too busy.<br><hr><br>- In the following examples, the same exact pattern is used to exclaim howgoodsomething is, so these uses are totallynotcomplaints. The English translations have to get a little more creative to express the same feeling in English.<br><ruby>你太好了。<rt>Nǐ tài hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>You are so great.<br><ruby>他太帅了。<rt>Tā tài shuài le.</rt></ruby><br>He is very handsome.<br><ruby>这 个 女孩太漂亮了。<rt>Zhège nǚhái tài piàoliang le.</rt></ruby><br>This girl is so pretty.<br><hr><br>- Note for the more advanced learner: This pattern can be used withmodal verbs(e.g. 会 (huì), 能 (néng)) as well as psychological verbs (e.g. 喜欢 (xǐhuan), 想 (xiǎng), 爱 (ài)) to intensify the degree.<br>- {{Source|Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar: A Practical Guide|57)→buy	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8HVFN		{}
Noun + 很 + Adj.<br>我很好。		- Simple 'noun + adjective' sentences<br>- In English, nouns can be 'linked' to adjectives and other nouns with the verb 'to be.' In Chinese,nounsare linked to other nouns in one way, but linked toadjectivesin a completely different way. Nouns are linked to othernouns with 是 (shì). Nouns are linked to adjectives with 很 (hěn).<br>- Noun + 很 + Adj.<br>- The noun in this structure is the subject of the sentence. Sometimes the 很 (hěn) in this structure is translated as 'very,' but often it is just a way to link a noun to an adjective.<br>- In the  following examples, 很 (hěn) is just a link (you could think of it as a substitute for the verb 'to be'), and the sentences could be translated as '(Noun) is (adjective).'<br><ruby>我很好。<rt>Wǒ hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I'm good.<br><ruby>你很漂亮。<rt>Nǐ hěn piàoliang.</rt></ruby><br>You are pretty.<br><ruby>他很高兴。<rt>Tā hěn gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>He is happy.<br><hr><br>- Remember that是 (shì) is not used to link adjectives to nouns. This is a classic mistake that almost everyone makes when learning Chinese. Make sure you use 很 (hěn) and not 是 (shì) to link adjectives to nouns, as shown below:<br><hr><br>- If you're like most learners, when you first learn this pattern, you're thinking,'How can 很 (hěn) mean 'very' one minute, but then nothing but a 'link' the next? How do I know if anything means anything in this language?'That's a reasonable response.  But in the case of these 'Noun + Adj.' sentences, you just have to think of this usage of 很 (hěn) as an exception. It's just part of the structure.<br>- If you actually want to add the meaning of 'very' into the sentence, you could use another adverb instead of 很 (hěn). One good choice is 非常 (fēicháng).<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG17BLH		{}
Verb + 不 + Verb / Adj. + 不 + Adj.<br>去 不 去？好 不 好?		- Affirmative-negative question<br>- A common way to form questions in Chinese is to first use averbin the positive, then repeat the same verb in its negative form, similar to how in English we can say, 'Do you have money or not?' or 'Have you or have you not been to the park?' This sentence pattern feels a lot more natural in Chinese than those admittedly awkward English equivalents, however.<br>- Verb + 不 + Verb<br><ruby>是 不 是？<rt>Shì bu shì?</rt></ruby><br>Is it (or not)?<br><ruby>他们来 不 来？<rt>Tāmen lái bu lái?</rt></ruby><br>Are they going to come or not?<br><ruby>你想 不 想我 ？<rt>Nǐ xiǎng bu xiǎng wǒ?</rt></ruby><br>Do you or do you not miss me?<br><hr><br>- Note that the question provides the listener with both possible answers: it's either 'Verb' or '不 (bù) Verb.'<br>- If you want to add an object after the verb, the general sentence structure is:<br>- Subj. + Verb + 不 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>你回 不 回家？<rt>Nǐ  huí bu huíjiā?</rt></ruby><br>Are you coming back home or not?<br><ruby>她吃 不 吃鱼？<rt>Tā chī bu chī yú?</rt></ruby><br>Does she eat fish?<br><ruby>你们要 不 要米饭？<rt>Nǐmen yào bu yào mǐfàn?</rt></ruby><br>Do you want rice?<br><hr><br>- It can also be done withadjectives(adjectives often behave like verbs in Chinese):<br>- Adj. + 不 + Adj.<br>- Again, the question provides the listener with both possible answers: it's either 'Adjective' or '不 (bù) Adjective.'<br>- These are something like adding tag questions in English, in this case 'Are you an adult or not?' If you wanted to translate it very literally, it would be, 'Are you or are you not an adult?' In any case, the structure is a very common way to ask questions in Chinese.<br>- All of the verbs used so far have been single-character verbs. Using two-characters verbs in affirmative-negative questions is slightly trickier. You usually put 不 (bù) after just the first character, then put the entire verb. For example 喜不喜欢 (xǐ bu xǐhuan) is the usual question form of 喜欢 (xǐhuan). You can repeat the whole two-character verb twice, but it's more common (and more elegant) to insert 不 (bù) after the first character (and the same is generally true of two-character adjectives).<br>- It can be done withverbs:<br>- [First Character of Verb] + 不 + Verb<br>- It can also be done withadjectives:<br>- [First Character of Adj.] + 不 + Adj.<br>- Because the verb有 (yǒu) is negated with 没 (méi)and not 不 (bù), the structure for affirmative-negative questions with 有 (yǒu) is:<br>- Subj. + 有 没有 + Obj.<br>- The possible answers are: '有 (yǒu)' or '没有 (méiyǒu).'<br>- The questions could be be asking about current possession ('Do you have it or not?'), or to ask aboutverbs in the past('Did you do it or not?').<br><ruby>你 哥哥有 没有女 朋友？<rt>Nǐ gēge yǒu méiyǒu nǚpéngyou?</rt></ruby><br>Does your older brother have a girlfriend?<br><ruby>你们有 没有孩子？<rt>Nǐmen yǒu méiyǒu háizi?</rt></ruby><br>Do you have children?<br><ruby>奶奶有 没有坐 过 飞机？<rt>Nǎinai yǒu méiyǒu zuò guo fēijī?</rt></ruby><br>Has grandma been on a plane?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGZH7K3		{}
什么 / 什么时候 / 谁 / 哪儿 / 为什么 / 怎么<br>你 是谁？你 在哪儿？		- Placement of question words<br>- Who,what,when,where,why, andhow: these question words are all used when forming questions in Chinese. The important thing to remember is thatword orderis the same in Chinese for questions and statements.<br>- In English, question words are also known aswh-words, as the majority of them begin withwh:<br>- In English, question words have to be placed at the beginning of the sentence. This involves changing theword orderto allow this rearrangement. In Chinese, using question words is a lot simpler. You simply place a question word in the place of the thing you want to ask about.Nothing needs to be rearranged.<br>- So if the statement is<br><ruby>我 是小李。<rt>Wǒ shì Xiǎo Lǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I am Xiao Li.<br><hr><br>- the question form - 'who are you?' - has the same word order:<br><ruby>你 是谁？<rt>Nǐ shì shéi?</rt></ruby><br>Who are you? (you are who?)<br><hr><br>- This works for whatever it is you want to ask about. The question form has the same word order as the statement form.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 什么 + (Noun) ?<br>- The words 哪里 (nǎlǐ) and 哪儿 (nǎr) mean the same thing. The difference is simply regional preference: 哪里 (nǎlǐ) is preferred in the south (Shanghai, Taiwan), whereas 哪儿 (nǎr) is preferred in the north (Beijing, Xi'an).<br>- Subj. + Verb + 哪里 / 哪儿 ?<br>- Subj. + Verb + 哪个 (+ Noun) ?<br>- Subj. + 是 + 谁 ?<br>- 谁 + Verb ?<br>- Subj. + 什么时候 + Predicate ?<br>- Examples for asking and tellingwhen(to keep things simple, we'll just include questions about the future; asking questions about the past can be slightly more complicated and may involve the'shi... de' construction).<br>- Subj. + 为什么 + Predicate ?<br>- Subj. + 怎么 + Verb (+ Obj.) ?	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJQPSC		{}
⋯⋯是不是 / 对不对 / 好不好 ?<br>你们 明天 来，好 不 好?		- Tag questions with 'bu'<br>- In the same way you cantag questions with 吗 (ma), tag questions can also be formed using 不 (bù). This is done by putting anaffirmative-negative questionat the end of a sentence.<br>- Verb + 不 + Verb<br>- This can then be attached to the end of a sentence to form a tag question. Tag questions seek confirmation or acceptance of what has been said. In English, 'right?' and 'OK?' are often used as tag questions.<br><ruby>你 会 说 中文 ，对 不 对？<rt>Nǐ huì shuō Zhōngwén,  duì bu duì? </rt></ruby><br>You speak Chinese, right?<br><ruby>他 是 你 的 老板 ，对 不 对？<rt>Tā shì nǐ de lǎobǎn, duì bu duì?</rt></ruby><br>He's your boss, right?<br><ruby>我们 是 好 朋友 ，对 不 对？<rt>Wǒmen shì hǎo péngyou, duì bu duì?</rt></ruby><br>We are good friends, right?<br><hr><br>- →buy	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG4D8XB		{}
⋯⋯是吗 / 对吗 / 好吗 ?<br>这样 做，对 吗?		- Tag questions with 'ma'<br>- As well asyes/no questions, you can also form tag questions with 吗 (ma). Tag questions are quick questions that are tagged on the end of a sentence to ask for confirmation. In English, this is often done with 'right?' or negatively with 'isn't it?'<br>- The easiest way to do this in Chinese is to add some kind of confirmation word and 吗 (ma) on the end of the sentence.<br>- As you can see below, the pattern typically involves words like 好 (hǎo), 对 (duì), 是 (shì), or 可以 (kěyǐ), followed by 吗 (ma).<br>- ⋯⋯， 好 / 对 / 是 / 可以 +  吗？<br>- By placing these on the end of a sentence, you can soften a suggestion or request confirmation.<br><ruby>这样 做，对 吗？<rt>Zhèyàng zuò, duì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do it like this, right?<br><ruby>你们 见 过，对 吗？<rt>Nǐmen jiàn guo, duì ma?</rt></ruby><br>You’ve met, right?<br><ruby>他们 昨天 都 没 去，是 吗？<rt>Tāmen zuótiān dōu méi qù, shì ma?</rt></ruby><br>They didn't go yesterday, right?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGSJYZ2		{}
⋯⋯吗？<br>他 是 老板吗?		- Yes-no questions with 'ma'<br>- The question particle 吗 (ma) is a simple way to form questions in Chinese. By placing 吗 (ma) on the end of a statement, you convert it into ayes/no question(questions that could be answered with 'yes' or 'no' in English).<br>- Any statement can be converted into a yes/no question with 吗 (ma). You could think of 吗 (ma) as being like a question mark you say out loud. So the basic structure is:<br>- [Statement] + 吗 ？<br>- The sentence 'You like coffee' can easily be converted into the question 'Do you like coffee?' by adding 吗 (ma):<br>- More examples of yes/no questions that revert to statements when you remove the 吗 (ma):<br>- It's important to remember that you do not normally add 吗 (ma) to a sentence that'salready a question. For example:<br>- These would be something like 'Are you who are you?' and 'Is this is a book?' in English, both obviously ungrammatical. Still, if you're not careful, you may find yourself throwing a 吗 (ma) onto the end of a question that doesn't need it.  Many learners make this mistake, so don't worry if it happens every once in a while, just catch it and remember it the next time.<br>- You can answer a Chinese yes-no question in one of two ways:<br>- Here's the slightly tricky part: if you answer with 对 (duì) and the question is in thepositive, then you're saying 'yes' (and affirming thepositiveverb in the question). If you answer with 对 (duì) and the question is in thenegative, then you're saying 'no' (and affirming thenegativeverb in the question). Let's take a look at some examples of this sort.<br>- Now let's try some answers that reuse the verb for a super-clear 'yes' or 'no,' which works the same way regardless of whether it's a positive or a negative verb in the question.<br>- Finally, a mix of the two ways to answer, where one person is asking questions of two different people.<br>- You sometimes hear that 'yes' in Chinese is是(shì) and 'no' is 不是 (bù shì). This can be true, butonly when the main verb in the question is also 是 (shì). If the verb in the question is something else, like 喜欢 (xǐhuan), then that verb becomes the word for 'yes.' It's been said that Chinese has hundreds of ways to say 'yes,' and this is why:every verb can be used to mean 'yes.'<br>- However, this doesn't mean that a sentencecan't everhave a question word and 吗 (ma). If a sentence contains verbs of understanding such as 知道 (zhīdào),了解 (liǎojiě), 明白 (míngbai), 认识 (rènshi), etc., then 吗 (ma) can still be added at the end of the question. You will later learn more about theseadvanced yes-no questions with 'ma'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQ2AZA		{}
二 vs 两<br>两个 人。二十二。		- Comparing 'er' and 'liang'<br>- In Chinese, there are two words for 'two.' They are 二 (èr) and 两 (liǎng), and each is used in different circumstances.<br>- The digit '2' is 二 (èr). This is used generally in numbers, when counting to ten, giving out a phone number, and so on.<br>- Unlike 两 (liǎng), 二 (èr) is not used to say there are 'two' of something, and does not generally occur withmeasure wordsby itself. Numbers like 十二 (12) (shí'èr) and 二十二 (22) (èrshí-èr) end with a '2' and can still be combined with measure words. In those cases, 两 (liǎng) is not needed.<br>- Here are some common examples of 二 (èr) in action:<br><ruby>第二<rt>dì-èr</rt></ruby><br>#2; second<br><ruby>第二个<rt>dì-èr gè</rt></ruby><br>the second one<br><ruby>第二次<rt>dì-èr cì</rt></ruby><br>the second time<br><hr><br>- When specifying quantities (and usingmeasure wordsto do it), 两 (liǎng) is used. This is when you want to say 'two of something' or 'both.'<br>- Here are some common examples of 两 (liǎng) in action:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJ46H1		{}
Adj. + 死了<br>我 今天 累死了。		- Negative adjectives with '-si le'<br>- In English, you might use the expression 'you scared me to death!' In Chinese,  死了 (sǐ le) is used similarly to intensify an adjective with an unpleasant connotation.<br>- The 'Subject' part below is actually optional, you can still make your over-the-top exclamations without it.<br>- Adj. + 死了<br>- This structure is technically a kind ofdegree complement.<br>- None of these sentences actually refers to someone dying. Instead the word 死了 (sǐ le) and the structure is simply used to intensify an adjective. Notice how these are awkward to translate into English; the translations above took a number of different angles to create the same impact as -死了 (sǐ le) does in Chinese. You might say that -死了 (sǐ le) is much more versatile in Chinese than the English expression 'to death.'<br>- Traditionally, -死了 (sǐ le) is only for adjectives with negative connotations, while positive connotations use a similar degree complement,极了 (jí le). In recent years, however, it's become quite popular to also use -死了 (sǐ le) with positive adjectives:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLEVUV		{}
Subj. + 差不多<br>我们 的 中文 水平差不多。		- Approximations with 'chabuduo'<br>- 差不多 (chàbuduō), translated literally, means 'the difference is not much.' In practice it means something like 'more or less,' and is useful for expressing rough approximations.<br>- As apredicate, 差不多 can be used pretty much all by itself to complete a sentence after you tell us what subject we're talking about. When several things are 差不多 (chàbuduō), it means they are 'more or lessthe same.' So actually 差不多 (chàbuduō) is often understood to mean 差不多一样 (chàbuduō yīyàng), but you don't say the 一样 (yīyàng) part. You just say 差不多 (chàbuduō).<br>- Let's first assume that the subject is an easily understood group of people or things.<br>- Subj. + 差不多<br>- You might also add a都(dōu) in before 差不多 (chàbuduō) if there are more than two things being compared.<br><ruby>这 几 个 地方 都差不多。<rt>Zhè jǐ gè dìfang dōu chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>These places are all pretty much the same.<br><ruby>这 两 个 词 的 意思差不多。<rt>Zhè liǎng gè cí de yìsi chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>The meanings of these two words are pretty much the same.<br><ruby>我们 的 想法差不多。<rt>Wǒmen de xiǎngfǎ chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>Our ways of thinking are pretty much the same.<br><hr><br>- Let's add in a few different subjects now, using the Chinese word for 'and.'<br>- Another often used structure is:<br>- A + 跟 / 和 +  B + 差不多<br><ruby>上海和纽约差不多。<rt>Shànghǎi hé Niǔyuē chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>Shanghai and New York are basically the same.<br><ruby>Starbucks和Costa差不多。<rt> Starbucks hé Costa chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>Starbucks and Costa are almost the same.<br><ruby>这里 的 天气跟台湾 的 天气差不多。<rt> Zhèlǐ de tiānqì gēn Táiwān de tiānqì chàbuduō.</rt></ruby><br>The weather here is pretty much like Taiwan's.<br><hr><br>- When using 差不多 (chàbuduō) as an adverb, place it before the adjective or verb.<br>- 差不多 + Adj. / Verb<br><ruby>这 两 个 孩子差不多大。<rt>Zhè liǎng gè háizi chàbuduō dà.</rt></ruby><br>These two children are more or less the same age.<br><ruby>我跟我哥哥差不多高。<rt>Wǒ gēn wǒ gēge chàbuduō gāo.</rt></ruby><br>My older brother and I are more or less the same height.<br><ruby>我差不多到 公园 门口 了。<rt>Wǒ chàbuduō dào gōngyuán ménkǒu le.</rt></ruby><br>I'm almost at the entrance of the park.<br><hr><br>- After 差不多 (chàbuduō) you can also add a phrase that expresses quantity or time. This makes it clear that you're giving a rough estimate.<br>- 差不多 ＋ [Quantity Phrase] / [Time Phrase]<br><ruby>你 儿子差不多五 岁 了 吧？<rt>Nǐ érzi chàbuduō wǔ suì le ba?</rt></ruby><br>Your son should be about 5 years old, right?<br><ruby>他 住 在 上海差不多三 个 月 了。<rt>Tā zhù zài Shànghǎi chàbuduō sān gè yuè le.</rt></ruby><br>He has lived in Shanghai for about three months.<br><ruby>我 在 这 家 公司 工作 了差不多十 年 了。<rt>Wǒ zài zhè jiā gōngsī gōngzuò le chàbuduō shí nián le.</rt></ruby><br>I've worked for this company for almost ten years.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1NAXO		{}
大家 / 很多人 + 都⋯⋯<br>很 多 地方都有 wifi。		- Emphasizing quantity with 'dou'<br>- 都 (dōu) is one of those words that on the surface may seem simple, but actually has many different subtle uses. In this article, we will look at using都(dōu) to emphasize quantity.<br>- You can use 都 (dōu) to emphasize the large quantity of something. The subject should be some sort of large group (like a majority of people or things), e.g. 很多人 (hěn duō rén) or 大家 (dàjiā).<br>- Subj. + 都 + Verb + Obj.<br>- First let's look at some typical examples using 很多 (hěn duō) to emphasize that it's 'a lot.'  Note that in English, it would be totally redundant and unnecessary to add 'all' into these sentences, but in Chinese it'stotally natural(and kind of weird not to).  If you remember to follow the rule and keep using the 都 (dōu), eventually it will become more natural for you too.<br><ruby>很 多地方都有 wifi。<rt>Hěn duō dìfang dōu yǒu wifi.</rt></ruby><br>A lot of places have wifi.<br><ruby>我 的很 多朋友都有 车。<rt>Wǒ de  hěn duō péngyou dōu yǒu chē.</rt></ruby><br>A lot of my friends have cars.<br><ruby>很 多美国人都喜欢 喝 咖啡 。<rt>Hěn duō  Měiguó rén dōu xǐhuan hē kāfēi.</rt></ruby><br>A lot of Americans like drinking coffee.<br><hr><br>- Now let's look at some examples using 大家 (dàjiā) or 'everyone.' Again, in English, it would be totally redundant and unnecessary to add 'all' into these sentences, but in Chinese it'stotally natural(and kind of weird not to).  You just have to get used to it.<br><ruby>大家都来 了 吗？<rt>Dàjiā dōu lái le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is everyone here?<br><ruby>大家都应该 知道。<rt>Dàjiā dōu yīnggāi zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone should know.<br><ruby>大家都说 你 很 聪明。<rt>Dàjiā  dōu shuō nǐ hěn cōngming.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone says you're smart.<br><hr><br>- One other common way to use 都 (dōu) is when you're talking about something that happens really often, such as 'every day': 每天 (měi tiān).  Use 都 (dōu) here in Chinese, even if it feels unnatural. (Fake it 'til you make it!)<br>- For more uses with 每 (měi), see also:Expressing 'every' with 'mei'.<br>- Here are some other examples that don't use 很多 (hěn duō) or 大家 (dàjiā) or 每天 (měi tiān), but are still quite typical:<br><ruby>美国人都说 英文。<rt>Měiguó rén dōu shuō Yīngwén.</rt></ruby><br>Americans all speak English.<br><ruby>我们 五 个 人都去。<rt>Wǒmen wǔ gè rén dōu qù.</rt></ruby><br>All five of us are going.<br><ruby>四川人都喜欢 吃辣。<rt>Sìchuān rén dōu xǐhuan chī là.</rt></ruby><br>Sichuanese people all like eating spicy food.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWNEYM		{}
(正) 在 + Verb<br>我们正在吃饭。		- Expressing actions in progress with 'zai'<br>- 在 (zài) and 正在 (zhèngzài) can be used asauxiliary verbsto express that an action isongoingorin progress. This is often the equivalent ofpresent continuousin English, which is how we express that an activity is happeningnow.<br>- You can use 正在 (zhèngzài) instead of just 在 (zài) to put a little more emphasis on an action that isin progressright now.<br>- Subj. + 在 + Verb + Obj.<br>- or<br>- Subj. + 正在 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>她在看 书。<rt>Tā zài kànshū.</rt></ruby><br>She is reading.<br><ruby>妈妈在打 电话。<rt>Māma zài dǎ diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>Mom is making a phone call.<br><ruby>谁在里面 洗澡？<rt>Shéi zài lǐmiàn xǐzǎo?</rt></ruby><br>Who is taking a shower in there?<br><hr><br>- There is no need to worry too much about when to use 在 (zài) or 正在 (zhèngzài), since they basically mean the same thing. 正在 (zhèngzài) usually shows that the action is in progress (right now). '在 (zài) + Verb' is more commonly used than '正在 (zhèngzài) + Verb,' but both are fine to use.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG846EA		{}
Subj. + 一直 + Predicate<br>我一直在 现在 的 公司 工作。		- Expressing 'all along' with 'yizhi'<br>- 一直 (yīzhí) literally means 'straight.'  Used as anadverb, 一直 (yīzhí) can also be used to express that you have been doing something all along, have been continuously doing something since a certain time, or that something will continuously happen in the future.<br>- This structure expresses the continuous nature of an action or a circumstance.<br>- Subj. + 一直 + Predicate<br>- Also note that although 一直 (yīzhí) means 'continuously,' it is frequently more natural to use the word 'always' in the English translation.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGP000J		{}
已经⋯⋯了<br>他已经走了。		- Expressing 'already' with 'yijing'<br>- 已经⋯⋯了 (yǐjīng... le) is the basic pattern used to express 'already' in Chinese. It's easy to forget the 了 (le) on the end, but using it will make your Chinese more natural.<br>- The most common structure is to use 已经⋯⋯了 (yǐjīng... le) with a verb phrase.<br>- 已经 + [Verb Phrase] + 了<br>- Sometimes anadjectiveor atime nounis used instead of a typical verb phrase:<br>- 已经 + (很 +) Adj. + 了<br><ruby>爸爸 妈妈已经老了。<rt>Bàba māma yǐjīng lǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>Mom and dad are already old.<br><ruby>已经很 便宜了。<rt>Yǐjīng hěn piányi le.</rt></ruby><br>It is already very cheap.<br><ruby>你 女朋友已经很 漂亮了！<rt> Nǐ nǚpéngyou yǐjīng hěn piàoliang le! </rt></ruby><br>Your girlfriend is already very beautiful! <br><hr><br>- A 'time noun' simply refers to almost any word in Chinese indicating a time something happened.<br>- 已经 + Time + 了<br><ruby>已经11点了，女儿 还 没 回来 。<rt>Yǐjīng shíyī diǎn le, nǚ'ér hái méi huílái.</rt></ruby><br>It is already 11 o'clock, and my daughter has not returned.<br><ruby>爷爷已经八十五 岁了。<rt>Yéye yǐjīng bāshí-wǔ suì le.</rt></ruby><br>Grandpa is already eighty-five years old.<br><ruby>我 学习 中文已经一 年了。<rt>Wǒ xuéxí Zhōngwén yǐjīng yī nián le.</rt></ruby><br>I have already been studying Chinese for a year.<br><hr><br>- The negative structure simply adds a 不 (bù) after 已经 (yǐjīng), and before the verb (or possibly adjective).<br>- 已经 + 不 + Verb + 了<br>- Generally this negative 已经 (yǐjīng) structure is translated into English as 'not... anymore' rather than using the word 'already.'<br><ruby>我已经不喜欢 你了。<rt>Wǒ yǐjīng bù xǐhuan nǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't like you anymore.<br><ruby>他已经不爱 他 的 猫了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng bù ài tā de māo le.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't love his cat anymore.<br><ruby>他们已经不住 在 中国了。<rt>Tāmen yǐjīng bù zhù zài Zhōngguó le.</rt></ruby><br>They don't live in China anymore.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNXI27		{}
总是 + Verb<br>他总是迟到。		- Expressing 'always' with 'zongshi'<br>- If you are trying to describe a daily routine, a habit, or just something that consistently happens, you can use the word 总是 (zǒngshì). 总是 (zǒngshì) means 'always,' and like otheradverbs, comes before the verb in a sentence.<br>- 总是 (zǒngshì) is an adverb that is often translated to English as 'always.' It is placed before the verb that it modifies.<br>- Subj. + 总是 + Verb<br><ruby>他总是迟到。<rt>Tā zǒngshì chídào.</rt></ruby><br>He is always late.<br><ruby>我总是忘记 这 个 词。<rt>Wǒ zǒngshì wàngjì zhège cí.</rt></ruby><br>I always forget this word.<br><ruby>他总是一个人 吃饭。<rt>Tā zǒngshì yīgèrén chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br>He always eats alone.<br><hr><br>- When 总是 (zǒngshì) is used together with an adjective, you will need to add a modifier in the middle, such as 很 (hěn), 特别 (tèbié),这么 (zhème), 那么 (nàme),etc.<br>- 总是 + Adv. + Adj.<br><ruby>他总是很 累。<rt>Tā zǒngshì hěn lèi.</rt></ruby><br>He is always tired.<br><ruby>你 为什么总是很 忙？<rt>Nǐ wèishénme zǒngshì hěn máng?</rt></ruby><br>Why are you always very busy?<br><ruby>你 家总是很 干净。<rt>Nǐ jiā zǒngshì hěn gānjìng.</rt></ruby><br>Your house is always very clean.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGXJPJS		{}
还 + Verb<br>她 有 一个 弟弟，还有 一个 妹妹。		- Expressing 'and also' with 'hai'<br>- In English we use 'and also' when we want to connect separate and different thoughts. We can do the same thing in Chinese by using 还 (hái).<br>- The adverb 还 (hái) can be used to link two phrases together, in a similar way to 'and also' in English. In this case, 还 (hái) begins a new phrase or clause.<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. 1， 还 + Verb + Obj. 2<br><ruby>她 有 一 个 弟弟，还有 一 个 妹妹。<rt>Tā yǒu yī gè dìdi, hái yǒu yī gè mèimei.</rt></ruby><br>She has a younger brother and also has a younger sister.<br><ruby>我 老板 会 说 法语，还会 说 日语。<rt>Wǒ lǎobǎn huì shuō Fǎyǔ, hái huì shuō Rìyǔ.</rt></ruby><br>My boss can speak French and can also speak Japanese.<br><ruby>你 要 一 杯 咖啡，还要 什么？<rt> Nǐ yào yī bēi kāfēi, hái yào shénme?</rt></ruby><br>You want a cup of coffee, and what else do you want?<br><hr><br>- It should be noted that another common way to express 'also' is with the word 也 (yě).  What's the difference? With 还 (hái), ONE subject is doing TWO different things, whereas when也 (yě)is used, TWO subjects are doing ONE thing.<br>- It's the difference between these two English sentences:<br>- If you translated these into Chinese, the first one (one subject, two actions) would use 还 (hái), and the second one (second subject, no new actions) would use 也 (yě). Let's do that!<br><ruby>他 做 了 饭 ，还洗 了 碗。<rt>Tā zuò le fàn, hái xǐ le wǎn.</rt></ruby><br>He fixed dinner and also washed the dishes.<br><ruby>她也洗 了 碗。<rt>Tā yě xǐ le wǎn.</rt></ruby><br>She washed the dishes too.<br><hr><br>- How about a few more similar examples?<br><ruby>我 洗 了 澡，还洗 了 衣服。<rt>Wǒ xǐ le zǎo, hái xǐ le yīfu.</rt></ruby><br> I took a shower and also did my laundry.<br><ruby>她也洗 了 衣服。<rt>Tā  yě xǐ le yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>She did her laundry too.<br><hr><br><ruby>我们 今天 晚上 出去 吃饭 了，还看 了 电影 。<rt>Wǒmen jīntiān wǎnshang chūqù chīfàn le, hái kàn le diànyǐng.</rt></ruby><br>We went out for dinner tonight and also watched a movie.<br><ruby>他们 今天 晚上也看 了 电影 。<rt>Tāmen jīntiān wǎnshang yě kàn le diànyǐng.</rt></ruby><br>They watched a movie tonight too.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJBZKC		{}
Subj. + 刚 + Verb<br>他刚走。		- Expressing 'just' with 'gang'<br>- For events that happened in the immediate past, in English we use the word 'just.' For example, if you pass a turn you were supposed to make, you might say, 'Ijustpassed it!' In Chinese, 'just' can be expressed with 刚 (gāng) or 刚刚 (gānggāng).<br>- 刚 (gāng) expresses an action that happened not long ago. 刚刚 (gānggāng) is used the same way, with the same meaning.<br>- Subj. + 刚 + Verb<br>- or<br>- Subj. + 刚刚 + Verb<br><ruby>我们刚知道。<rt>Wǒmen gāng zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>We just found out.<br><ruby>她们刚走。<rt>Tāmen gāng zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>They just left.<br><ruby>老板刚刚到 办公室。<rt> Lǎobǎn gānggāng dào bàngōngshì.</rt></ruby><br>The boss just arrived at the office.<br><hr><br>- This more complicated use of 刚 (gāng) is not nearly as essential as the one above, but you may find it useful to specify justwhenthe event 'just' occurred, specifically.<br>- 刚 (gāng) can also express 'from the time an action happens until the present time.'<br>- Subj. + 刚 + Verb (+ Obj.)  + Duration<br>- Note that although we need to say 'ago' in English, in this pattern there's no need for a word that means 'ago.'<br><ruby>我刚认识 她十 天。<rt>Wǒ gāng rènshi tā shí tiān.</rt></ruby><br>I just met her ten days ago.<br><ruby>他刚来 中国两 个 月。<rt>Tā gāng lái Zhōngguó liǎng gè yuè.</rt></ruby><br>He just got to China two months ago.<br><ruby>我 弟弟刚工作半年。<rt>Wǒ dìdi gāng gōngzuò  bàn nián .</rt></ruby><br>My younger brother just started working half a year ago.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQJJYO		{}
只 + Verb<br>我只有 一个 妹妹。		- Expressing 'only' with 'zhi'<br>- There are a number of different ways to express 'only' in Chinese, but 只 (zhǐ) is the most basic one you need to learn first. It's anadverb, so it normally comes beforeverbs.<br>- The adverb 只 (zhǐ) can come directly before averb, or before anauxiliary verblike会(huì) or能(néng).<br>- 只 + Verb<br>- 只 + 会 / 能 + Verb<br><ruby>我只有 一 个 哥哥。<rt>Wǒ zhǐ yǒu yī gè gēge.</rt></ruby><br>I only have one older brother.<br><ruby>我们只有 十块 钱。<rt>Wǒmen zhǐ yǒu shí kuài qián.</rt></ruby><br>We only have ten RMB.<br><ruby>我们 公司只有 两个员工。<rt>Wǒmen gōngsī zhǐ yǒu liǎng gè yuángōng.</rt></ruby><br>Our company only has two employees.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGN8C8R		{}
就 + Verb Phrase<br>我们 现在 有 时间，就去吧。		- Expressing 'then' with 'jiu'<br>- The adverb就(jiù) has quite a few uses in Chinese, and appears in several common patterns. This is the first and simplest usage you need to know, though, and it means something similar to 'then.'<br>- Usually the first part of the sentence will set up a situation. Then the second part, with 就 (jiù) leading the way, indicates what should be done as a result.<br>- ..., 就 + Verb Phrase<br>- Not always easy to translate, you could think of 就 (jiù) as meaning 'just' or 'then.'<br><ruby>你 喜欢 喝 奶茶，我们就买 奶茶 吧。<rt>Nǐ xǐhuan hē nǎichá, wǒmen jiù mǎi nǎichá ba.</rt></ruby><br>So you like milk tea. Then we'll buy milk tea.<br><ruby>你 最 有 经验，就听 你的 吧。<rt>Nǐ zuì yǒu jīngyàn,  jiù tīng nǐ de ba.</rt></ruby><br>You have the most experience. We'll just listen to you.<br><ruby>我 听到 这个 坏 消息，就给 你 打 电话 了。<rt>Wǒ tīngdào zhège huài xiāoxi, jiù gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà le.</rt></ruby><br>As soon as I heard this bad news, I called you.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEB54D		{}
别 + Verb<br>别走。		- Negative commands with 'bie'<br>- Instead of saying 'do not' with不要 (bùyào), we can say 'don't' a little more quickly and forcefully by using 别 (bié).<br>- Besides using不要 (bùyào), negative commands can also be formed with 别 (bié). You could think of 别 (bié) as a contraction of 不要 (bùyào), as the structure is the same for both:<br>- 别 + Verb (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>别走。<rt>Bié zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>Don't leave.<br><ruby>别说话！<rt>Bié shuōhuà! </rt></ruby><br>Don't speak! <br><ruby>别笑！<rt>Bié xiào! </rt></ruby><br>Don't laugh! <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9W0UX		{}
一边 + Verb 1 (，) 一边 + Verb 2<br>不要一边说话 ，一边吃 东西。		- Simultaneous tasks with 'yibian'<br>- Multitasking is everywhere in the modern world (what else are you doing while you read this?), but you if canfocusfor just a minute, you can learn a way to express simultaneous tasks in Chinese! This can be done with 一边 (yībiān).<br>- To express that one thing is donewhiledoing something else, the word 一边 (yībiān) is used.<br>- Subj. + 一边 + Verb (，) + 一边 + Verb<br>- Note that you sometimes see 一边 (yībiān) shortened to 边 (biān) as well, which has a less formal feel.<br><ruby>不要一边吃 东西，一边说话 。<rt>Bùyào yībiān  chī dōngxi, yībiān shuōhuà.</rt></ruby><br>Don't speak while eating.<br><ruby>我 常常一边洗澡，一边唱歌 。<rt>Wǒ chángcháng yībiān xǐzǎo, yībiān chànggē.</rt></ruby><br>I often sing songs while I take a shower.<br><ruby>孩子 喜欢一边吃饭，一边玩 。<rt>Háizi xǐhuan yībiān chīfàn, yībiān wán.</rt></ruby><br>Children like to play while eating.<br><hr><br>- You'll notice that the order of the two actions is sometimes different in the original Chinese and the English translations above. This is because the 'main' action usually comes second in English (after the 'while'), but first in Chinese. For example, 'take a shower while singing' sounds strange in English, but 'sing while taking a shower' doesn't.<br>- Note that you must be actively doing both actions. That is, they have to be intentional. If you want to say something happened while another thing was happening, it would be better to use的时候 (de shíhou).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG2ZC5S		{}
Subj. + 多 + Adj. ?<br>他多高？		- Asking about degree with 'duo'<br>- How big? How busy? How cold?Ask questions like these regarding the degree of an adjective with 多 (duō). This is just one of the many uses of this word.<br>- 多 (duō) is often used to ask about the degree or extent of something.<br>- Subj. + 多 + Adj. ?<br>- This is an easy way to ask 'How [adjective] is [subject]?'<br><ruby>她多高？<rt>Tā duō gāo?</rt></ruby><br>How tall is she?<br><ruby>你家多大？<rt>Nǐ jiā duō dà?</rt></ruby><br>How large is your house?<br><ruby>你 的 孩子多大？<rt>Nǐ de háizi duō dà?</rt></ruby><br>How old is your child?<br><hr><br>- 大 (dà) and 小 (xiǎo) can also be used to describe ages. The question phrase 多大 (duō dà) is often used to ask 'how old.' However, it is an informal way to ask, usually reserved for peers, close friends, or children. The phrase 几岁 (jǐ suì) is most often used for children young enough to display their ages on one hand. Adults do not normally directly ask each other's ages in a formal setting.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9LLJU		{}
Noun 1 + 跟 / 和 + Noun 2 + 一样 + Adj.<br>你跟他一样高 。		- Basic comparisons with 'yiyang'<br>- Along with比 (bǐ)and没有 (méiyǒu), 一样 (yīyàng) is another way to make basiccomparisons. However, 一样 (yīyàng) is used to express that two things arethe samein some way.<br>- This simple structure is used for stating that two things are the same:<br>- Noun 1 + 跟 / 和 + Noun 2 + 一样<br><ruby>我和你一样。<rt>Wǒ hé nǐ yīyàng.</rt></ruby><br>I am the same as you.<br><ruby>他 的 性格跟他 妈妈一样。<rt>Tā de xìnggé gēn tā māma yīyàng.</rt></ruby><br>He has the same personality as his mom.<br><ruby>北京 的 天气和上海  不一样。<rt>Běijīng de tiānqì hé Shànghǎi bù yīyàng.</rt></ruby><br>The weather in Beijing and the weather in Shanghai are not alike.<br><hr><br>- To add an adjective into the mix, just place it after 一样 (yīyàng):<br>- Noun 1 + 跟 / 和 + Noun 2 + 一样 + Adj.<br>- This describes Noun 1 as being asadjectiveas Noun 2.<br><ruby>你家跟我家一样大。<rt>Nǐ jiā gēn  wǒ jiā yīyàng dà.</rt></ruby><br>Your house is just as big as mine.<br><ruby>她和她 哥哥一样高。<rt>Tā hé tā gēge yīyàng gāo.</rt></ruby><br>She and her older brother are equally tall.<br><ruby>你 的 头发和我的 头发一样长。<rt>Nǐ de tóufa hé wǒ de tóufa yīyàng cháng.</rt></ruby><br>You hair is as long as mine.<br><hr><br>- There is also a similar but more advanced usage of this pattern thatuses 像 (xiàng).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC06N0		{}
有点(儿) + Adj.<br>我有点饿 。		- Expressing 'a little too' with 'you dian'<br>- At times you may want to politely diss something using the phrase 'a little too.'  For example, if you are getting lunch with a friend who wants to be seated outside, you might say, 'It is a little too hot' to suggest you sit inside. In a case like this, you can use 有一点 (yǒuyīdiǎn) or 有点 (yǒudiǎn). The two are interchangeable.<br>- To say that something is 'a littletoo...' or 'a bittoo...,' 有一点 (yǒuyīdiǎn) is often used. Its northern Chinese version is 有一点儿 (yǒuyīdiǎnr).<br>- Subj. + 有一点(儿) + Adj.<br>- In spoken Chinese, the 一 (yī) in 有一点 (yǒuyīdiǎn) is often dropped, leaving 有点 (yǒudiǎn).  In northern China, that's usually pronounced 有点儿 (yǒudiǎnr).<br>- Subj. + 有点(儿) + Adj.<br><ruby>我有点饿 。<rt>Wǒ yǒudiǎn è.</rt></ruby><br>I'm a little hungry.<br><ruby>这个 菜有点辣 。<rt>Zhège cài yǒudiǎn là.</rt></ruby><br>This dish is a little too spicy.<br><ruby>昨天有一点热 。<rt>Zuótiān yǒuyīdiǎn rè.</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday it was a little too hot.<br><hr><br>- Note that for the speaker, the adjective after 有点 (yǒudiǎn) expresses an unpleasant or undesirable meaning, so you won't hear things like 有点高兴 (yǒudiǎn gāoxìng), 有点舒服 (yǒudiǎn shūfu), 有点好玩儿 (yǒudiǎn hǎowánr), etc., because 'happy,' 'comfortable,' and 'fun' are all adjectives with positive connotations.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPM3MY		{}
又⋯⋯ 又⋯⋯<br>他又高又帅。		- Expressing 'both A and B' with 'you'<br>- When you're getting descriptive, you may find yourself wanting to use multipleadjectivesat a time. The character 又 (yòu) can be used to give two qualities to something. Using the double 又 (yòu) structure is like saying that something is 'both… and…' in English.<br>- The structure in Chinese is:<br>- Subj. + 又 + Adj. 1 + 又 + Adj. 2<br>- The two words shouldn't contrast in feeling. It is important to note they must both be bad or both be good.<br><ruby>她 男朋友又高又帅。<rt>Tā nánpéngyou yòu gāo yòu shuài.</rt></ruby><br>Her boyfriend is both tall and handsome.<br><ruby>这 个 房子又大又亮。<rt>Zhège fángzi yòu dà yòu liàng.</rt></ruby><br>This house is both big and bright.<br><ruby>妈妈 的 头发又黑又亮。<rt>Māma de tóufa yòu hēi yòu liàng.</rt></ruby><br>Mom's hair is both black and shiny.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPFUM2		{}
Place 1 + 离 + Place 2 + Adv. + 近 / 远<br>我 家离大学 很 近。		- Expressing distance with 'li'<br>- Are we there yet? One of the ways to express distance is to use 离 (lí). The word order might seem a little tricky at first, but once you get it down, you'll be able to talk about distance with no problem.<br>- Unless you're talking about a very specific distance, you'll normally want to pair 离 (lí) with the adjective 近 (jìn) for 'close,' or 远 (yuǎn) for 'far.'<br>- Place 1 + 离 + Place 2 + Adv. + 近 / 远<br>- So this pattern is normally used to simply express that one place is (not) close or (not) far from another place.  Easy, right?  It's learning the sentence pattern that usually trips learners up, because it doesn't feel like naturalword orderto a speaker of English.<br><ruby>我 家离公司 很 近。<rt>Wǒ jiā lí gōngsī hěn jìn.</rt></ruby><br>My house is close to my office.<br><ruby>美国离中国 很 远。<rt>Měiguó lí Zhōngguó hěn yuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>The USA is far from China.<br><ruby>这 个 酒店离火车站 很 近。<rt>Zhège jiǔdiàn lí huǒchēzhàn hěn jìn.</rt></ruby><br>This hotel is very close to the train station.<br><hr><br>- These two sentence patterns are extremely common in everyday conversations when discussing distances.<br>- Place 1 + 离 + Place 2 (+ Adv.) + 近 / 远 + 吗？<br>- Place 1 + 离 + Place 2 (+ 有) + 多远？<br>- Note that in English, you can actually ask, 'How close is it from here?' if the distance is obviously short. But in Chinese it's just, 'How far is it from here?'<br><ruby>你家离超市 远 吗？<rt> Nǐ jiā lí chāoshì yuǎn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is your house far away from the supermarket?<br><ruby>你 的 大学离你 老家 很 远 吗？<rt>Nǐ de dàxué lí nǐ lǎojiā hěn yuǎn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is your college very far away from your hometown? <br><ruby>你们 公司离地铁站 近 吗？<rt>Nǐmen gōngsī lí dìtiězhàn jìn ma? </rt></ruby><br>Is your company close to the metro station? <br><hr><br>- One final example is a command, commonly heard in colloquial Chinese:<br><ruby>你离我 远 点 儿 ！<rt>Nǐ lí wǒ yuǎn diǎnr!</rt></ruby><br>Stay away from me.<br><hr><br>- It's a somewhat atypical usage when compared with the others, because it uses two people rather than two places. The sentence literally means, 'Distance yourself from me further.' In other words, 'Stay away from me,' or 'Don't come near me.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGI96BQ		{}
更 + Adj.<br>我 想 找 一个更有钱 的 男朋友。		- Expressing 'even more' with 'geng'<br>- To express 'even more,' (as in 'even more expensive,' 'even more ridiculous,' 'even more badass'), you can use 更 (gèng). 更 (gèng) generally comes beforeadjectives.<br>- The pattern in Chinese is simple:<br>- 更 + Adj.<br>- Note that this pattern is not simply a way of adding '-er' to an adjective or a substitute for比 (bǐ) comparisons.  In each case, you're adding 'even more' to an existing considerable amount, as in, 'I'm already rich, but I want to be even richer.'<br>- While 更 (gèng) is not a substitute for比 (bǐ) (the classic comparison word), the two can be used together.<br>- A 比 B + 更 + Adj.<br>- This expresses that 'A iseven moreAdj. than B.'<br><ruby>北京 的 房子比上海更贵。<rt>Běijīng de fángzi  bǐ Shànghǎi gèng guì.</rt></ruby><br>The houses in Beijing are even more expensive than those in Shanghai.<br><ruby>春节比中秋节更热闹。<rt>Chūnjié  bǐ Zhōngqiūjié gèng  rènao.</rt></ruby><br>Spring Festival is even more boisterous than Mid-autumn Festival.<br><ruby>汉字比声调更难。<rt>Hànzì  bǐ shēngdiào gèng nán.</rt></ruby><br>Chinese characters are even more difficult than tones.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG4NIPB		{}
不太 + Adj.<br>他不太高兴 。我不太喜欢。		- Expressing 'not very' with 'bu tai'<br>- You may be familiar with using太 (tài) to express 'too,'such as when something is 'too expensive' or 'too hot.' 不太 (bù tài) is a similar pattern for the negative, which just means 'not very' or 'not so' (literally 'not too').  Note that this pattern does not normally use 了 (le).<br>- Subj. + 不太 + Adj.<br>- Note: This pattern can also be used with non-adjectives.  See below for more info.<br><ruby>我 家不 太大。<rt>Wǒ jiā bù tài dà.</rt></ruby><br>My house is not too big.<br><ruby>那 个 地方不 太远。<rt>Nàge dìfang bù tài yuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>That place is not very far away.<br><ruby>老板 今天不 太高兴。<rt> Lǎobǎn jīntiān bù tài gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>The boss is not very happy today.<br><hr><br>- This pattern can be used with somepsychological verbs(e.g. 喜欢 (xǐhuan), 想 (xiǎng), 明白 (míngbai)), as is the case with the next examples. These verbs are relatively limited.<br>- Subj. + 不太 + Verb<br><ruby>我不 太懂 。<rt>Wǒ bù tài dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>I don't really understand.<br><ruby>我不 太会 说 英语 。<rt>Wǒ bù tài huì shuō Yīngyǔ.</rt></ruby><br>I can't really speak English.<br><ruby>他们不 太想 去 。<rt>Tāmen bù tài xiǎng qù.</rt></ruby><br>They don't really want to go.<br><hr><br>- {{Source|Integrated Chinese: Level 1, Part 1|180-181)→buy	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGUNMHU		{}
真 + Adj.<br>你 女朋友真漂亮 。		- Expressing 'really' with 'zhen'<br>- As anadverb, the word 真 (zhēn) means 'really' or 'truly.'<br>- 真 (zhēn) is used only in exclamatory sentences and comes before an adjective.<br>- 真 + Adj.<br><ruby>你真好！<rt>Nǐ zhēn hǎo!</rt></ruby><br>You are so nice! <br><ruby>你 女朋友真漂亮！<rt>Nǐ nǚpéngyou zhēn piàoliang! </rt></ruby><br>Your girlfriend is really pretty!<br><ruby>他 家真有钱！<rt>Tā jiā zhēn yǒuqián! </rt></ruby><br>His family is really rich!<br><hr><br>- We don't want to get too technical on you, but there are certain other words that can be jazzed up with 真 (zhēn). One type of word isauxiliary verbs, like 能 (néng) and 会 (huì). The other type ispsychological verbslike 喜欢 (xǐhuan).<br>- 真 + Verb<br><ruby>你 妈妈真爱 你！<rt>Nǐ māma zhēn ài nǐ! </rt></ruby><br>Your mother really loves you! <br><ruby>我真喜欢 住 在 中国！<rt>Wǒ zhēn xǐhuan zhù zài Zhōngguó!</rt></ruby><br>I really like living in China! <br><ruby>我真讨厌 这 种 男人！<rt>Wǒ zhēn tǎoyàn zhè zhǒng nánrén!</rt></ruby><br>I really hate this kind of guy! <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC885D		{}
Subj. + 多 + Adj.<br>多好！外面多舒服！		- Intensifying with 'duo'<br>- One way to intensify a sentence is to make it an exclamation. To do this, you can use 多 (duō).<br>- As well asasking about degree, you can also use 多 (duō) to intensify adjectives.<br>- Subj. + 多 + Adj.<br><ruby>一个人多好！<rt>Yīgèrén duō hǎo!</rt></ruby><br>It's so nice being alone! <br><ruby>你 女儿多聪明 啊！<rt>Nǐ nǚér duō cōngming a! </rt></ruby><br>Your daughter is so smart! <br><ruby>今天 天气多舒服 ！<rt>Jīntiān tiānqì duō shūfu! </rt></ruby><br>Today's weather is so nice! <br><hr><br>- 多 (duō) can be compared to 很 (hěn) in this case. If you use 很 (hěn) instead of 多 (duō), the meaning is basically the same. However 很 (hěn) is also used to makesimple 'noun + adjective' sentences, which might not be exclamatory at all, whereas 多 (duō) is used only for excited exclamations.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGGH7RR		{}
还 + Adj.<br>还可以。还好。		- Moderating positive adjectives with 'hai'<br>- Whenever you want to imply that something is 'good,' but also kind of 'meh,' you can use 还 (hái) in front of the 'good' adjective.<br>- Besides expressingcontinuation, 还 (hái) can also be used to weaken positive adjectives. Used with the adjective 'good,' this is similar to saying 'fairly good' or 'pretty good' in English. It's also sometimes used by a speaker to be more modest. Below are some of the most common adjectives that get 'toned down' by 还 (hái) in this structure.<br>- Subj. + 还 + 好 / 可以 / 行 / 不错<br>- In this pattern, 好 (hǎo), 可以 (kěyǐ), 行 (xíng), and 不错 (bùcuò) combined with 还 ()hái can all be taken to mean 'pretty good' or 'all right' or 'decent' (but also kind ofmeh... notgreat). As in English, intonation and facial expressions help convey the meaning. If expectations were already low to begin with, 还可以 (hái kěyǐ) can have the sense of 'pretty darn good;' it all depends on context and tone of voice.<br><ruby>我还 好。<rt>Wǒ hái hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I'm OK.<br><ruby>爸爸 做 的 菜还 可以。<rt>Bàba zuò de cài hái kěyǐ.</rt></ruby><br>The food that dad cooks is OK.<br><ruby>我们 老板还 不错。<rt>Wǒmen lǎobǎn hái bùcuò.</rt></ruby><br>Our boss is not too bad.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGAY164		{}
Adj. + 的 + Noun<br>好喝 的啤酒 /可爱 的宝宝		- Modifying nouns with adjective + 'de'<br>- One of the best ways to use the common character 的 (de) is to spice up yournounswithadjectives. By using 的 (de), we can connect sassy adjectives to otherwise boring nouns.<br>- A very common way to modify nouns is to attach an adjective to them using 的 (de).<br>- Adj. + 的 + Noun<br>- This structure comes up extremely frequently and is an easy way to attribute features to nouns. Occasionally you will see this 的 (de) omitted, but note that if the adjective has two characters (e.g. 漂亮 (piàoliang) or 高兴 (gāoxìng)), the 的 (de) is generally required.<br><ruby>漂亮 的女孩儿<rt>piàoliang de nǚháir</rt></ruby><br>beautiful girl <br><ruby>辣 的菜<rt>là de cài </rt></ruby><br>spicy food <br><ruby>可爱 的宝宝<rt>kě'ài de bǎobao</rt></ruby><br>a cute baby <br><hr><br>- In some cases, it is possible to drop the noun from the pattern, and just use the adjective + 的 (de). This is kind of like saying 'the big one' or 'the red one' in English. In Chinese the 的 (de) serves the same purpose as the English word 'one.' By using this pattern, you can avoid repeating the same noun over and over again unnecessarily. Just be sure the other person is already clear which 'one' you're referring to when using this pattern!<br>- Adj. + 的	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVUFKX		{}
Phrase + 的 + Noun<br>去 北京的火车。今天 来的人。		- Modifying nouns with phrase + 'de'<br>- In addition tolinking adjectives to nouns, 的 (de) can also be used to link a whole phrase to a noun, making the already useful 的 (de) even more useful.<br>- As well asattaching adjectives to nouns, 的 (de) can be used to attach whole phrases to nouns. In English this is often achieved with 'who' or 'that.' For example,  'the man who went to Beijing' or 'the book that I bought yesterday.'<br>- Phrase + 的 + Noun<br>- Here the phrase is typically of the form 'Noun + Verb.' The pattern, by itself, doesn't make clear whether the action happened in the past, present, or future.<br><ruby>妈妈 做的菜<rt> māma zuò  de cài</rt></ruby><br>the food that mom cooks / cooked<br><ruby>去 北京的火车<rt>qù Běijīng  de huǒchē</rt></ruby><br>the train that goes / went to Beijing<br><ruby>你 教的学生<rt>nǐ jiāo  de xuésheng</rt></ruby><br>the students that you teach / taught<br><hr><br>- In some cases, it is possible to drop the noun from the pattern, and just use the 'Noun + 的 (de).'

By using this pattern, you can avoid repeating the same noun over and over again unnecessarily. Just be sure the other person is already clear about the 'what' you're referring to when using this pattern!<br>- Phrase + 的<br>- Note that for certain phrases, it may be ambiguous what the 'what' refers to, and sometimes it could even refer to a 'who.'<br><ruby>妈妈 做的<rt> māma zuò  de</rt></ruby><br>what mom cooks / cooked<br><ruby>我 画的<rt>wǒ huà  de </rt></ruby><br>what I draw / drew<br><ruby>他 写的<rt>tā xiě  de</rt></ruby><br>what he writes / wrote<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLQKD2		{}
最 + Adj. (+ 了)<br>谁最有钱 ？		- Superlative 'zui'<br>- The most common way to form a superlative (best, worst, biggest, smallest, etc.) in Chinese is to use 最 (zuì) before anadjective(and a few selectverbs).<br>- The structure is:<br>- 最 + Adj.<br>- And now you have the superlative form of the adjective. Unlike in English, this structure is consistent for all adjectives in Chinese. The inconsistencies in English sometimes confuse beginners, so note in the examples below how to say 'best,' 'worst,' 'least,' and 'most' (meaning 'greatest number').<br><ruby>哪 个 老师最好？<rt>Nǎge lǎoshī zuì hǎo? </rt></ruby><br>Which teacher is the best?<br><ruby>你们 家 谁最漂亮？<rt>Nǐmen jiā shéi zuì piàoliang? </rt></ruby><br>In your family who is the most beautiful? <br><ruby>谁最有钱 ？<rt>Shéi zuì yǒuqián?</rt></ruby><br>Who is the richest?<br><hr><br>- Occasionally you'll also see a 了 (le) added after the adjective.  This simply adds emphasis to the '-est.'<br>- 最 + Adj. (+ 了)<br>- 最 (zuì) can also come beforepsychological verbs, to express what one 'most likes,' 'most hates,' etc. It won't make sense if you try to use 最 (zuì) with non-psychological verbs, though.<br>- The structure is:<br>- 最 + [Psychological Verb] + Obj. (+ 了)<br>- Note the 了 (le) on the end there!

⋯⋯或者⋯⋯<br>我 想 去 青岛或者南京。		- Expressing 'or' in statements<br>- In English, 'or' can be used to connect words when offering or considering choices ('do you want chicken or beef?'). It can also be used as an 'or'statement('it doesn't matter if we eat chicken or beef'), in Chinese, this is what 或者 (huòzhě) is used for.<br>- While 还是 (háishì) is used for'or' in questions, 或者 (huòzhě) is used for 'or' instatements.<br>- Possibility 1 + 或者 + Possibility 2<br><ruby>我 喝咖啡或者茶，都 行。<rt>Wǒ hē kāfēi huòzhě chá, dōu xíng.</rt></ruby><br>I drink coffee or tea.

跟⋯⋯ + Verb<br>你 要跟我 一起 去 吗？		- Expressing 'with' with 'gen'<br>- Using 跟 (gēn) to express 'with' is so simple and helpful, after studying it briefly, it will always bewithyou! 跟 (gēn) is a very common word that will help complete many other sentence structures.<br>- The preposition 跟 (gēn) is commonly used to express 'with.'  Just remember that the 'with' phrase comesbefore the verb.<br>- Subj. + 跟 + Person + Verb + Obj.<br>- The word 一起 (yīqǐ) is used a lot with 跟 (gēn), expressing the idea of 'doing somethingtogether withsomebody.' It may seem kind of redundant, but it's totally normal in Chinese to use both.<br>- Also, for most of the examples below, 跟 (gēn) is interchangeable with 和 (hé), which you may remember,  also means 'and,' just like 跟 (gēn) does.<br>- Subj. + 跟 + Person + 一起 + Verb + Obj.<br>- Certain Chineseverbsuse 跟 (gēn) a lot, so be on the lookout for them (examples below)!<br><ruby>我 昨天跟朋友去海滩 了。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān gēn péngyou  qù  hǎitān le.</rt></ruby><br>I went to the beach with friends yesterday.<br><ruby>不要跟我说话！<rt>Bùyào gēn wǒ shuōhuà!</rt></ruby><br>Don't talk to me!<br><ruby>我 明天 要跟新 客户见面。<rt>Wǒ míngtiān yào gēn xīn kèhù jiànmiàn.</rt></ruby><br>I'm going to meet new clients tomorrow.<br><hr><br>- Note:One of the most common beginner mistakes is to fail to use 跟 (gēn) with 见面 (jiànmiàn), 'to meet.' It might help to think of 见面 (jiànmiàn) as 'to meetwith(somebody),' the 'with' cluing you into the fact that you need a 跟 (gēn) in there. The verbs 结婚 (jiéhūn), 'to marry,' and 聊天 (liáotiān), 'to chat' are used with 跟 (gēn) in the exact same way.<br>- Check out the examples below:<br><hr><br>- Later on you'll learn more aboutwhy this is the case, but for now just memorize the correct pattern.<br>- We mentioned earlier that 跟 (gēn) is essentially interchangeable with 和 (hé).  There's at least one common usage where this is not the case, though:<br><hr><br>- The reason is that although 跟 (gēn) and 和 (hé) can both mean 'and' or 'with,' the word 跟 (gēn) also has a sense of 'to follow' embedded in it. There's a before/after aspect.<br>- The following sentences are both correct, because they're simultaneous rather than before/after:<br><hr><br>- Because of this slight difference between 跟 (gēn) and 和 (hé), it's recommended to start out using 跟 (gēn) to mean 'with.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGSZ0HP		{}
⋯⋯那个⋯⋯<br>那个⋯⋯你 可以 做 我 的 女 朋友 吗？		- The filler word 'neige'<br>- In conversation, you may find yourself at a loss for words, unable to find the correct phrase you are looking for, or simply needing time to gather your thoughts. When you experience this feeling, in English, you may say 'umm' or 'uhhh' or another filler word. In Chinese, the word for this is 那个 (nèige). (The word 那个 can be pronounced both 'nàge' and 'nèige,' but for this usage, 'nèige' is normally used.)<br>- In English, words like 'ummm' and 'uh' are used asfiller wordswhen you're thinking about what to say. In Chinese, 那个 (nèige) is also used for this purpose. To English speakers not fortunate enough to be fluent in Mandarin this may raise an eyebrow because it can sound a bit 'racist,' but it's very common in Mandarin and you'll hear it quite often around Chinese speakers.<br>- (那个⋯⋯) (那个⋯⋯) + [anything] + (那个⋯⋯)<br>- 那个 (nèige) can be inserted into sentences wherever you need to pause for thought.<br><ruby>那个⋯⋯ 我 不 跟 你们 一起 去 了，可以 吗？<rt>Nèige... wǒ bù   gēn nǐmen yīqǐ qù le, kěyǐ ma? </rt></ruby><br>So, ummm...

……，可是 / 但是……<br>我 喜欢 他，可是/但是他 不 喜欢 我。		- Two words for 'but'<br>- Using 'but' in Chinese is really simple to learn. It involves the two words 可是 (kěshì) and 但是 (dànshì). Make no 'buts' about it; you'll understand it in no time!<br>- There are two main words for 'but' in Chinese: 可是 (kěshì) and 但是 (dànshì). These are largely the same.  The small difference is that 但是 (dànshì) is slightly more formal, whereas 可是 (kěshì) is just a bit more informal and a tad weaker in tone.  You really don't need to worry about which one is the right one to use though, since they can be used interchangeably.<br>- Statement， 可是 / 但是 + [Contrary Statement]<br>- Usually 可是 (kěshì) and 但是 (dànshì) precede a new phrase within a sentence:<br><ruby>我 喜欢 他，可是他 不 喜欢 我。<rt>Wǒ xǐhuan tā, kěshì tā bù xǐhuan wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>I like him, but he doesn't like me.<br><ruby>我 很 想 去，但是我 太 忙 了。<rt>Wǒ hěn xiǎng qù, dànshì wǒ tài máng le.</rt></ruby><br>I really want to go, but I am too busy.<br><ruby>中文 很 有意思，但是也 很 难。<rt>Zhōngwén hěn yǒuyìsi, dànshì yě hěn nán.</rt></ruby><br>Chinese is very interesting, but it is also very hard.<br><hr><br>- Note:In informal spoken Chinese, 可是 (kěshì) can be shortened to 可 (kě), and 但是 (dànshì) can be shortened to 但 (dàn).<br>- {{Source|Chinese Reference Series for Foreigners - 1700 Groups of Frequently Used Chinese Synonyms (外国人学汉语工具书 - 1700对近义词语用法对比)]] (p.319)	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGUD81S		{}
Time / Verb + 以后<br>10点以后，我 不 在 家。		- After a specific time with 'yihou'<br>- Just as以前 (yǐqián) can be usedto describe the eventsbeforea specific time, 以后 (yǐhòu) can be used to describe the eventsaftera specific time.<br>- This grammar structure is similar to the English 'after such-and-such, something happens.' It's quite simple, all you have to do is put the 'after' after the time words or time phrase.<br>- Time / Verb + 以后, ....<br>- The time can be a time or date, or an action or event. It may or may not be in the future.<br><ruby>下午 三点以后， 我 不 在 家。<rt>Xiàwǔ  sāndiǎn yǐhòu, wǒ bù zài jiā.</rt></ruby><br>After three p.m., I will not be at home.<br><ruby>来 中国以后， 她 认识 了 她 的 老公。<rt>Lái Zhōngguó yǐhòu, tā rènshi le tā de lǎogōng.</rt></ruby><br>After coming to China, she met her husband.<br><ruby>她一个月以后开始 上班。<rt>Tā yī gè yuè yǐhòu kāishǐ shàngbān.</rt></ruby><br>After one month, she will start working.<br><hr><br>- Note that this use of 以后 (yǐhòu) is often shortened to 后 (hòu).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGRLQGY		{}
Time / Verb + 以前<br>十 点以前，我 在 家。		- Before a specific time with 'yiqian'<br>- As well as talking about thepast in general, you can use 以前 (yǐqián) to talk about things that happenedbeforea specific time.<br>- Time / Verb + 以前 ，⋯⋯<br>- The time can be a specific time, or an action (technically, 'whenthe action was done').<br><ruby>吃饭以前，你 洗 手 了 吗？<rt>Chīfàn yǐqián, nǐ xǐ shǒu le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you wash your hands before eating? <br><ruby>睡觉以前，不要 吃 东西。<rt>Shuìjiào yǐqián, bùyào chī dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>Don't eat anything before you go to sleep.<br><ruby>两 年以前， 你 认识 他 吗？<rt>Liǎng nián  yǐqián,  nǐ rènshi tā ma? </rt></ruby><br>Did you know him two years ago?<br><hr><br>- Note that this use of 以前 (yǐqián) can also be shortened to 前 (qián).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJ2OJC		{}
以前，⋯⋯<br>以前，我 不 会 说 中文。		- Expressing 'before' in general with 'yiqian'<br>- To talk about things that previously occurred, you can use the word 以前 (yǐqián). You can use this structure to talk about actions that happened at some unspecified time in the past.<br>- One way to use 以前 (yǐqián) is to start the sentence with it. This is like starting off a sentence in English with 'before...' or 'in the past...'<br>- 以前 + Subj. + Verb + Obj.<br>- You can also move 以前 (yǐqián) to right after the subject, and it's also correct.<br>- Subj. + 以前 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>以前我 不 会 说 中文 。<rt>Yǐqián wǒ bù huì shuō Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>Before, I could not speak Chinese.<br><ruby>你以前住 在 哪儿？<rt>Nǐ yǐqián zhù zài nǎr?</rt></ruby><br>Before, where did you live?<br><ruby>以前我 不 认识 他。<rt>Yǐqián wǒ bù rènshi tā.</rt></ruby><br>Before, I didn't know him.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVCWLU		{}
刚才 + Verb<br>你刚才说什么 了？		- Expressing 'just now' with 'gangcai'<br>- In order to say that something 'just now' occurred, use thetime noun刚才 (gāngcái). It can be placed in front of the verb or the subject of a statement.<br>- This grammar structure is pretty straightforward. Similar to the English 'just now,' you can put 刚才 (gāngcái) right before the verb in a sentence. It can also come before or after the subject.<br>- 刚才 + Verb<br><ruby>你刚才说什么 了？<rt>Nǐ gāngcái shuō shénme le? </rt></ruby><br>What did you just say? <br><ruby>刚才谁来了？<rt>Gāngcái shéi   lái le? </rt></ruby><br>Who came just now? <br><ruby>刚才你去哪儿 了？<rt>Gāngcái nǐ qù nǎr le? </rt></ruby><br>Where did you go just now? <br><hr><br>- Note that for all of those cases, we're talking about something that happenedjust now, as in, within the past 5 minutes or so. If you're talking about something that 'just happened' yesterday or last week, don't use 刚才 (gāngcái), use刚 (gāng).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQ1KOY		{}
⋯⋯的时候<br>你 不在的 时候，我 会 想 你。		- Expressing 'when' with 'de shihou'<br>- In English, if we are reflecting on a past time, we often say, 'whenI was a child' or 'whenI was in school.' In Chinese, this can also be expressed by using 的时候 (de shíhou).<br>- To talk about events that happenedatorduringa particular time, 的时候 (de shíhou) is often used. This is simply attached to the word or phrase indicating the time:<br>- (Subj.) + Verb / Adj. + 的 时候, ....<br>- As time words can appearbefore or after the subject, you can also place the 'Time + 的时候  (de shíhou)' after the subject:<br>- Time Word + 的 时候, ....<br><ruby>你不 在的时候，我 会 想 你。<rt>Nǐ  bù zài de shíhou, wǒ huì xiǎng nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>When you are not here, I'll miss you.<br><ruby>我上 大学的时候，有 很 多 朋友。<rt>Wǒ shàng dàxué de shíhou, yǒu hěn duō péngyou.</rt></ruby><br>When I was in college, I had a lot of friends.<br><ruby>上课的时候不要 吃 东西。<rt>Shàngkè de shíhou bùyào chī dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>Don't eat when you are in class.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWN185		{}
以后，⋯⋯<br>以后，你 不要 问 我。		- In the future in general with 'yihou'<br>- Similar to talking about things in the past, talking about things in the future is very straight forward. You can use the simple but useful  以后 (yǐhòu), which also means 'later.'<br>- To talk about things happening at some unspecified time in the future, you can use 以后 (yǐhòu). The structure is:<br>- 以后 + Subj. + Verb + Obj.<br>- You can also move 以后 (yǐhòu) to right after the subject, and it's also correct.<br>- Subj. + 以后 + Verb + Obj.<br>- This can be used to talk about actions in the future, or to talk about events that happenedafter other eventsin a story.<br>- In the examples below, the translation 'in the future' is used, because using 'later' for 以后 (yǐhòu) either sounds weird, or makes it sound like it's going to happen really soon (just a little later), rather than at some indefinite point in the future, which is what is meant.<br><ruby>以后你们 会  想我 吗？<rt>Yǐhòu nǐmen huì xiǎng wǒ ma? </rt></ruby><br>In the future, will you miss me? <br><ruby>以后你 想 来 中国 吗？<rt>Yǐhòu nǐ xiǎng lái Zhōngguó ma? </rt></ruby><br>In the future, do you want to come to China? <br><ruby>我以后不 喝酒 了。<rt>Wǒ yǐhòu bù hējiǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>I will not drink alcohol in the future.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPVFU1		{}
Subj. + Time⋯⋯ / Time + Subj.⋯⋯<br>我明天有 空。/明天我 有 空。		- Time words and word order<br>- Remembering where to put the time words, such as 'yesterday,' 'tomorrow,' 'this week,' etc. in a sentence is really important in order to speak Chinese correctly. In Chinese you get two equally correct choices.<br>- Time words can appear in one of two positions in the sentence in Chinese: either at the beginning of the sentence (before the subject), or directly after the subject. The structures are:<br>- Time+ Subj. + Verb + Obj.<br>- Subj. +Time+ Verb + Obj.<br>- So if you start speaking with 'time first' English word order, you can carry on and get away with it.  If, however, you're saving the time word for theendof the sentence, you can be pretty sure that it doesn't sound at all natural to your Chinese audience.<br><ruby>昨天我去 了 酒吧 。<rt>Zuótiān wǒ qù le jiǔbā.</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday I went to the bar.<br><ruby>我昨天去 了 酒吧 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān qù le jiǔbā.</rt></ruby><br>I went to the bar yesterday.<br><hr><br><ruby>下 个 星期他要 回 国 。<rt>Xià gè xīngqī tā yào huí guó.</rt></ruby><br>Next week he is going back to his country.<br><ruby>他下 个 星期要 回 国 。<rt>Tā xià gè xīngqī yào huí guó.</rt></ruby><br>He is going back to his country next week.<br><hr><br><ruby>明年我要 开 一 个 公司 。<rt>Míngnián wǒ yào kāi yī gè gōngsī.</rt></ruby><br>Next year I want to open a company.<br><ruby>我明年要 开 一 个 公司 。<rt>Wǒ míngnián yào kāi yī gè gōngsī.</rt></ruby><br>I want to open a company next year.<br><hr><br><ruby>下 个 月我们结婚 吧 ？<rt>Xià gè yuè wǒmen jiéhūn ba?</rt></ruby><br>Next month shall we get married?<br><ruby>我们下 个 月结婚 吧 ？<rt>Wǒmen xià gè yuè jiéhūn ba?</rt></ruby><br>Shall we get married next month?<br><hr><br><ruby>现在你能 来 我 办公室 吗 ？<rt>Xiànzài nǐ néng lái wǒ bàngōngshì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Now you can come to my office?<br><ruby>你现在能 来 我 办公室 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ xiànzài néng lái wǒ bàngōngshì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you come to my office now?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5RWKO		{}
Number 1 + Number 2<br>三 四个 人。一 两天。		- Approximating with sequential numbers<br>- Expressing approximate numbers in Chinese is quite simple, and this article introduces one of the most basic ways to do so.<br>- An easy way to express approximate numbers is to use two sequential numbers in a row.<br>- Number + (Number + 1)<br>- This is similar to saying 'x or y' or 'about x' in English.<br><ruby>一 两天<rt>yī liǎng tiān</rt></ruby><br>one or two days<br><ruby>三 四个 人<rt> sān sì gè rén</rt></ruby><br>three or four people<br><ruby>老板 昨天 喝 了七 八瓶 胡萝卜 汁 。<rt>Lǎobǎn zuótiān hē le qī bā píng húluóbo zhī.</rt></ruby><br>The boss drank 7 or 8 bottles of carrot juice yesterday.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGOUD8U		{}
Number + 万 / 亿<br>五万		- Big numbers in Chinese<br>- The manner in which large numbers are broken down in Chinese is a little different from English. Unlike in English, where large numbers are broken down by the number ofthousandsthey have, Chinese forms numbers between 10,000 and 100,000,000 based off of how manytensof thousands they have (with another set of rules for numbers 100,000,000 onwards that will be explained later). While the structure can be difficult to grasp for some learners, there are some easy ways to remember how to form these big numbers.<br>- Mandarin has two units that English doesn't have (or at least, it has unique words for these units, whereas English describes them with combinations of other units). These are:<br>- 万 (wàn) comes up the most often and is the largest stumbling block for most people learning Mandarin numbers. In English, numbers are usually broken up into chunks of three digits. Because of 万 (wàn), it's easier to break numbers up into groups of four in Mandarin. In English, we split 'twelve thousand' numerically into '12,000' (chunks of three digits). Split it the Chinese way, '1,2000,' and the Chinese reading '一万两千' (onewanand two 'thousand' = yīwàn liǎngqiān) makes more sense.<br>- One way to remember how to write out numbers 10,000 through 99,999 in Chinese characters is that in Chinese, the comma is (mentally) moved one digit to the left. For example, 11,000 could be thought of in tens of thousands as '1,1000,' with 万 (wàn) replacing the comma, and then what's left written as 一千 (yīqiān): 一万一千 (yīwàn yīqiān).<br>- After 99,999,999, there is yet another new numerical unit, 亿 (yì), which is used to express 'hundred million.' A number like 1,101,110,000 would be written out as '十一亿一百一十一万 (shíyī yì yībǎi yīshí-yī wàn).' Again, an easier way to translate between the two methods is to write the number out in English, move the comma one digit to the left, and then insert the appropriate characters in their respective places, replacing the commas.<br>- One more simple way to remember how to correctly write out large numbers is to pick one or two numbers and just memorize them. One million, for example, is 一百万 (yībǎi wàn). If you can memorize that, then going to 一千万 (yīqiān wàn) is way easier and faster, since you don't have to count all those zeroes.<br>- The recommended shortcuts are:<br><ruby>五万两千 一百 五十二<rt> wǔwàn liǎngqiān yībǎi wǔshí-èr </rt></ruby><br>52,152<br><ruby>二百 九十一万四千 六百 八十<rt>èrbǎi  jiǔshí-yī wàn sìqiān liùbǎi  bāshí </rt></ruby><br>2,914,680<br><ruby>七百 八十九万零 二百 九十八<rt>qībǎi bāshí-jiǔ wàn líng èrbǎi jiǔshí-bā </rt></ruby><br>7,890,298<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIM3AX		{}
Number 1 + 点(钟) + Number 2 + 分<br>现在十一点十八分。		- Structure of times (advanced)<br>- If you already knowthe basics of how to tell time in Chinese, you may want to get a little more specific or sophisticated, using words like 分 (fēn) and 刻 (kè).<br>- Minutes are marked with 分 (fēn) (short for 分钟 (fēnzhōng)). The way to include them in the time depends on whether they're minutespastortothe hour.<br>- Minutespastthe hour are expressed after 点 (diǎn) in the same way as half and quarter hours.<br>- In Chinese, when the minute is under 10, the word 零 (líng) is often used after 点 (diǎn). For example, 2:07 would be said as “两点零七分” (liǎng diǎn líng qī fēn). However, note that when speaking, it is very common for most Chinese people take out the “分 (fēn)” at the end of the time.<br>- x 点 零 y 分<br><ruby>两点零九分<rt>liǎng diǎn líng jiǔ fēn</rt></ruby><br>2:09<br><ruby>三点零八分<rt>sān diǎn líng bā fēn</rt></ruby><br>3:08<br><ruby>五点零三分<rt>wǔ diǎn líng sān fēn</rt></ruby><br>5:03<br><hr><br>- There's nothing tricky about this, since there's no 零 (líng).

It also works!<br>- When expressing how many minutes it will be till the next full hour, you put 差 (chà) in front of the time expression.<br>- Minutestothe hour use this structure:<br>- 差 + Minutes + 分 + Hour + 点<br>- or<br>- Hour + 点 + 差 + Minutes + 分<br><ruby>差五 分 三点<rt>chà wǔ fēn sān diǎn</rt></ruby><br>five minutes til 3 o'clock<br><ruby>十二点差三 分<rt>shí'èr diǎn chà sān fēn </rt></ruby><br>three minutes til 12 o'clock<br><ruby>差五 分 八点半<rt>chà wǔ fēn bā diǎn bàn</rt></ruby><br>five minutes til 8:30<br><hr><br>- Only the basic 分 (fēn) usage is tested on HSK1.

几 + Measure Word + Noun<br>桌子 上 有几本 书。		- Using 'ji' to mean 'several'<br>- One of the definitions of the common character 几 (jǐ) is 'several,' 'a couple' or 'a few.' It's an uncertain number that is at least more than one, and probably less than five, but definitely less than ten.<br>- The simplest way to use 几 (jǐ) to mean 'a few' is to use it directly with a measure word.<br>- 几 + Measure Word + Noun<br><ruby>桌子 上 有几本 书。<rt>Zhuōzi shàng yǒu jǐ běn shū.</rt></ruby><br>There are a few books on the table.<br><ruby>只有几个 人 去 过 那 个 地方。<rt>Zhǐyǒu jǐ gè rén qù guo nàge dìfang.</rt></ruby><br>Only a few people have been to that place.<br><ruby>从 上海 到 东京 坐 飞机 只 要几个 小时。<rt>Cóng Shànghǎi dào Dōngjīng zuò fēijī zhǐ yào jǐ gè xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br>Flying from Shanghai to Tokyo only takes a few hours.<br><hr><br>- It is similar to how in English we can say, 'a few dozen' or 'a couple dozen,' though in this case instead of 'twelves of something' we are saying 'tens of something.'<br>- 几 + 十 + Measure Word + Noun<br>- In Chinese we can put 几 (jǐ) together with 百 (bǎi), 千 (qiān), or 万 (wàn), just like how in English we might say, 'a few hundred' or a 'few thousand.'<br>- 几 + 百 / 千 / 万 + Measure Word + Noun<br><ruby>妈妈 每 个 月 都 给 我几 百块 钱。<rt>Māma měi gè yuè dōu gěi wǒ jǐ bǎi kuài qián.</rt></ruby><br>Mom gives me a couple hundred dollars every month.<br><ruby>这 个 月 我们 卖 了几 千本 书。<rt>Zhège yuè wǒmen mài le jǐ qiān běn shū.</rt></ruby><br>We sold a couple thousand books this month.<br><ruby>几 百家 外国 公司 参加 了 这个 大会。<rt>Jǐ bǎi jiā wàiguó gōngsī cānjiā le zhège dàhuì.</rt></ruby><br>Several hundred foreign companies attended this conference.<br><hr><br>- You can think of 好几 (hǎojǐ) as meaning 'quite a few,' usually in the range of five to ten.<br>- 好几 + Measure Word + Noun<br><ruby>他 读 了好几遍 。<rt>Tā dú le hǎojǐ biàn.</rt></ruby><br>He's read quite a few times.<br><ruby>我 有好几个 室友 。<rt>Wǒ yǒu hǎojǐ gè shìyǒu.</rt></ruby><br>I have quite a few roommates.<br><ruby>我 奶奶 有好几个 孩子 。<rt>Wǒ nǎinai yǒu hǎojǐ gè háizi.</rt></ruby><br>My grandma has quite a few children.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGHC9CA		{}
⋯⋯了<br>我 25 岁了。		- Change of state with 'le'<br>- 了 (le) has many uses.  You probably first learned 了 (le) as aparticlethat tells youan action is completed, which is also known as '了1.' However, this article is not about that use of 了 (le); instead, it is about indicating achange of state(了2).  In other words, there is now a new situation, or there is about to be a new situation.  This whole 'change of state' idea can take numerous forms, and this page includes some helpful examples.<br>- When anadjectiveindicates a change to the subject, 了 (le) is placed at the end of the sentence to indicate a change of state.<br>- Subj. + Adj. + 了<br>- When following a verb or verb phrase, the 了 (le) indicates a change in an overall situation. For these sentences, sometimes you can translate this 了 (le) as 'now.'<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了<br>- When you take the same 'change of situation' pattern and put a 不 (bù) before the verb, you're indicating that something already decided has changed. What had once been green-lit is now getting a red light. What was once 'on' is now 'off.' The 'change of situation' indicated by 了 (le) is still the same, although the change is often simply mental: it's a change of plans, or a change of intent.<br>- Subj. + 不 + Verb + 了<br>- This pattern is somewhat similar toexpressing 'not anymore' with 'le'.<br>- The whole 'change of state' concept might seem very general, and it is. It's vague, and it also takes some getting used to. You should expect it to take a while to get used to this use of 了 (le).<br>- Because it's a little vague and confusing, most learners find it useful to break this 'change of state' 了 (le) down into more specific usages, such as using it to mean'now','already', or'not anymore'. Although these are all 'flavors' of the 'change of state' 了 (le), identifying them as specific cases can make it much easier to get used to using 了 (le) in this way.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGT185D		{}
⋯⋯吧<br>那 好吧。		- Conceding with 'ba'<br>- The particle 吧 (ba) can also be used toconcedea point. That is, 吧 (ba) can be used to accept or agree with something that you're not particularly happy about, the way we might use 'all right' or 'fine then' in English.<br>- Similar toother uses of 吧(ba), this usage is also simply placed on the end of a sentence or statement.<br>- Statement + 吧<br>- To understand what someone is conceding to, it's best to present this usage as a number of super short dialogs which provide a little context.<br>- In this first one, B has to accept that his luxury goods shopping dreams have been shattered.<br>- Now B must accept inconvenient schedule changes.<br>- B is now conceding that going out in this crazy rain doesn't make sense.<br>- Now B is agreeing to let more guys into his secret club.<br>- Now B is having a friend cancel plans on him.

Subj. + Verb Phrase + 了<br>你 应该 问 老师 。我 问了。		- Expressing 'already' with just 'le'<br>- You understand the word已经 (yǐjīng)to mean 'already' in Chinese, and it is followed with a了 (le). However, sometimes, that feeling of 'already' can also be expressed with 了 (le) alone if it is used in response to a preceding question or statement.<br>- Subj. + [Verb Phrase] + 了<br>- When 'already' is implied using this structure, it is usually (if not always) in response to a preceding question or statement. Therefore, the following examples are in dialog format.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGM055L		{}
Subj. + Verb + 了 + Obj.<br>我 吃了两 个 苹果。		- Expressing completion with 'le'<br>- The particle 了 (le) has alot of uses. One of the most common is to express the completion of an action. This is calledaspect, which is not the same as tense. Tense is aboutwhen an action happens: past, present or future. With regards to 了 (le), aspect is aboutwhether the action is completein a certain time frame.<br>- The simplest way to use 了 (le) is to just put it after a verb. When there's nothing else after the verb, there are no complications!<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了<br><ruby>他们 到了。<rt>Tāmen dào le.</rt></ruby><br>They have arrived.<br><ruby>我 买了。<rt>Wǒ mǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>I've bought it.<br><ruby>我们 都 去了。<rt>Wǒmen dōu qù le.</rt></ruby><br>We all went.<br><hr><br>- Here is where things start to get slightly more complicated. If the verb has an object, 了 (le) can go directly after the verb to indicate completion, but there are a few other conditions that should be met.<br>- It's a good idea tospecify the timeanyway, if you're still getting used to Chinese verbs not indicating tenses by themselves. When you do this, it's generally OK to put the 了 (le) right after the verb and before the object.<br>- Subj. + Time + Verb + 了 + Obj.<br>- Time + Subj. + Verb + 了 + Obj.<br><ruby>我今天吃了早饭 。<rt>Wǒ jīntiān chī le zǎofàn.</rt></ruby><br>This morning I ate breakfast.<br><ruby>她上个 月去了北京 。<rt>Tā shàng gè yuè qù le  Běijīng.</rt></ruby><br>Last month she went to Beijing.<br><ruby>中午我 见了朋友 。<rt>Zhōngwǔ wǒ jiàn le péngyou.</rt></ruby><br>At noon I met a friend.<br><hr><br>- This pattern works if the sentence includes more information about the object, such ashow manythere are.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + [Number + Measure Word] + Obj.<br>- (Make sure you're clear onwhat a measure word is and how to use them.)<br><ruby>老师 问了五 个问题 。<rt>Lǎoshī wèn le wǔ gè wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher asked five questions.<br><ruby>我 买了三 本书 。<rt>Wǒ mǎi le sān běn shū.</rt></ruby><br>I bought three books.<br><ruby>我 喝了两 杯咖啡 。<rt>Wǒ hē le liǎng bēi kāfēi.</rt></ruby><br>I drank two cups of coffee.<br><hr><br>- OK, so here's the tricky part. Even when indicating completion, the 了 (le) can sometimes go after the object. This is not a topic that can be covered in depth at theelementary level, but you should be aware thatthis does happentoo.<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. + 了<br><ruby>上个 月 我 去台湾了。<rt>Shàng gè yuè wǒ qù Táiwān le.</rt></ruby><br>I went to Taiwan last month.<br><ruby>昨天 晚上 我 看见UFO了。<rt>Zuótiān wǎnshang wǒ kànjiàn UFO le.</rt></ruby><br>I saw a UFO last night.<br><hr><br>- If you'reupper intermediate-ish and think you can 'handle the truth,' also check out our more advanced, full exposé on了 (le) after an object.<br>- So what happens if a whole string of things happened in the past? Do you have to put a 了 (le) after each one, just like we'd put each verb in the past tense in English? Good question! The short answer is that you only need one 了 (le).<br>- To keep things simple, we'll make the first action 'coming' or 'going' somewhere, which will be followed by another action. So we'll be using 来 (lái) or 去 (qù) plus a place in each sentence, and then another action. For this type of 'consecutive action,' 了 (le) should be placed after thefinalverb (or verb phrase), which marks the completion of the entire sequence.<br>- Subj. + 来 / 去 + Place + Verb / [Verb Phrase] + 了<br><ruby>昨天 她来我 家吃饭了。<rt>Zuótiān tā lái wǒ jiā chīfàn le.</rt></ruby><br>She came to my place and ate dinner yesterday.<br><ruby>我们 上周去北京开会了。<rt>Wǒmen shàng zhōu qù Běijīng kāihuì le.</rt></ruby><br>We went to Beijing and had a meeting there last week.<br><ruby>我 和 朋友去商场买 衣服了。<rt>Wǒ hé péngyou qù shāngchǎng mǎi yīfu le.</rt></ruby><br>I went to the mall with my friend and bought some clothes.<br><hr><br>- 了 (le) can appear in sentences about the future as well as the past. What's important is whether or not the action has beencompleted, no matter what time frame we're talking about. This also means that this 了 (le) isn't used with habitual or continuous actions.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGAGDCQ		{}
Verb + 过<br>我 去过中国 。		- Expressing experiences with 'guo'<br>- Theaspect particle过 (guo) is used to indicate that anaction has been experiencedin the past.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 过 + Obj.<br>- What this expresses is that the verbhas beendone at least once before, without specifying a particular time. 过 (guo) is used to talk about whether something haseverhappened - whether ithas been experienced.<br>- In English, if you're asking a question and really trying to figure out if someone haseverdone something before, we tend to use the words 'ever' and 'before.'  In Chinese, 过 (guo) alone expresses this, without the need for additional words.<br><ruby>你 学过中文 吗？<rt>Nǐ xué guo Zhōngwén ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have you ever studied Chinese?<br><ruby>你 见过那 个 人 吗？<rt>Nǐ jiàn guo nàge rén ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have you seen that person before?<br><ruby>我们 来过这 个 地方。<rt>Wǒmen lái guo zhège dìfang.</rt></ruby><br>We've been to this place before.<br><hr><br>- Because 过 (guo) is used to talk about past actions, it should benegated with 没(méi).<br>- Subj. + 没 + Verb + 过 + Obj.<br>- Note that when you translate these examples into English, 'havenever' [done something] is often more natural, indicating that someonelacks theexperienceof having done something, rather than just 'have not' [done something].<br><ruby>我没想过这 个 问题。<rt>Wǒ méi xiǎng  guo zhège wèntí.</rt></ruby><br> I've never thought about this question before.<br><ruby>我没学过这 个 词 。<rt>Wǒ méi xué guo zhège cí.</rt></ruby><br>I have never studied this word before.<br><ruby>妈妈没买过很 贵 的 衣服。<rt>Māma méi mǎi guo  hěn guì de yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>Mom has never bought any expensive clothes before.<br><hr><br>- To emphasize 'never' even more, you can alsouse the word 从来 (cónglái).<br>- You'll sometimes see 过 (guo) used together with 了 (le).  This can be a little confusing, as it doesn't seem to be following the rules laid out above.  For more on this special usage of 过 (guo), see the article onusing 过 (guo) with 了 (le).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQGV3P		{}
不 / 没(有) + Verb Phrase + 了<br>我不想 吃了。		- Expressing 'not anymore' with 'le'<br>- In a negative sentence, thesentence-final 了 (le)can take on the meaning of '(not) anymore' or 'no longer.'  The word已经 (yǐjīng), whichmeans 'already,'may nor may not accompany it.<br>- 不 + [Verb Phrase] + 了<br>- Note that without the 了 this pattern is still correct, but then the resulting sentence wouldno longerindicate a change(which is the whole point of the word 'anymore').<br><ruby>我不想 吃了。<rt>Wǒ bù xiǎng chī le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't want to eat anymore.<br><ruby>你不喜欢 我了吗？<rt>Nǐ bù xǐhuan wǒ le ma?</rt></ruby><br>You don't like me anymore?<br><ruby>你们不能 打了。<rt>Nǐmen bù néng dǎ le.</rt></ruby><br>You can't fight anymore.<br><hr><br>- 没(有) + [Noun Phrase] + 了<br>- Again, without the 了 this pattern is still correct, but then the resulting sentence wouldno longerindicate a change(which is the whole point of the word 'anymore').<br>- Use of the word已经(yǐjīng) to mean 'anymore' is optional for this pattern, but either不(bù) or没有(méiyǒu) will be needed to make the verb negative. Thesentence-final 了 (le)is required, though,since 已经 is used.<br>- 已经 + 不 + [Verb Phrase] + 了<br>- 已经 + 没(有) + [Noun Phrase] + 了<br><ruby>我已经不住 这里了。<rt>Wǒ yǐjīng bù zhù zhèlǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't live here anymore.<br><ruby>他已经不在 这儿 工作了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng bù zài zhèr gōngzuò le.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't work here anymore.<br><ruby>他们已经不在 一起了。<rt>Tāmen yǐjīng bù zài yīqǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>They are no longer together.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGFR96B		{}
New Situation + 了<br>吃饭了！		- Expressing 'now' with 'le'<br>- 现在 (xiànzài) isn't the only way to express 'now.'  You'll notice that in many common expressions,了 (le)is used in place of the word for 'now.'<br>- This pattern is actually the same aschange of state with 'le', but the examples below are somewhat idiomatic and can also easily be confused with a direct translation of 'now' in Chinese, so they get special treatment here.<br>- [New Situation] + 了	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGE5Q4J		{}
⋯⋯呢 ?<br>我 不 要 回家 。还 早呢！		- Modal particle 'ne'<br>- You may have already learned how to askquestions with 呢 (ne), but did you know that it's also used in statements? In this usage, 呢 (ne) is imparting a certain 'mood' (hence the word 'modal') or 'attitude.' It's used when trying to sound more confident and convincing to someone else.<br>- Statement + 呢<br>- For each of these examples, just a bit of context is needed to understand what the speaker is trying to convince someone of.<br><ruby>我 不 要 回家 。还 早呢！<rt>Wǒ bù yào huíjiā. Hái zǎo ne!</rt></ruby><br>I don't want to go home. It's still early!<br><ruby>太 远 了，坐 火车 要 十 个 小时呢。<rt>Tài yuǎn le, zuò huǒchē yào shí gè xiǎoshí ne.</rt></ruby><br>It's too far.

⋯⋯啊<br>是啊！谁啊？		- Sentence-final interjection 'a'<br>- The interjection 啊 (a) is often added to the end of sentences to add a tone of urgency, exclamation or excitement. However, the exact meaning often  depends on context.<br>- When used like this, 啊 (a) is placed at the end of a statement and has a tone of exclamation, excitement or enthusiasm.  (In a lot of cases, the only English 'translation' you can offer is an exclamation point.)<br>- 啊 (a) can also add a sense of certainty or urgency to a statement, sometimes with the feeling of an order.<br><ruby>是啊，我 也 觉得 ！<rt>Shì a, wǒ yě juéde! </rt></ruby><br>Definitely, I think so too! <br><ruby>行啊！<rt>Xíng a!</rt></ruby><br>All right! <br><ruby>可以啊！<rt>Kěyǐ a! </rt></ruby><br>It's fine!<br><hr><br>- Finally, it can be used with questions, again with a sense of urgency or concern for the listener.<br><ruby>你 走 不 走啊？<rt>Nǐ zǒu bu zǒu a? </rt></ruby><br>Are you going or what? <br><ruby>你 吃 不 吃啊？<rt>Nǐ  chī bu chī a? </rt></ruby><br>Are you eating or not? <br><ruby>谁 说 的啊？<rt>Shéi shuō de a? </rt></ruby><br>Who said so? <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGW66JM		{}
⋯⋯吧<br>这样 不 太 好吧。		- Softening speech with 'ba'<br>- The particle 吧 (ba) can be used to soften the feel of a sentence. This could be to make it more polite, gentler and less forceful, or to turn a command into a suggestion.<br>- Statement + 吧<br><ruby>这 不 太 好吧。<rt> Zhè bù tài hǎo ba.</rt></ruby><br>This isn't so good.<br><ruby>算了吧。<rt> Suàn le ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's forget it.<br><ruby>应该 是吧。<rt> Yīnggāi shì ba.</rt></ruby><br>It should be.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGDHC1H		{}
的 / 得 / 地<br>红色的车，跑得很快，慢慢地走		- Structural particle 'de'<br>- The structural particle 'de' has three written forms in modern Chinese, each with its own uses:<br>- There is also amodal particle 的(de), not covered in this grammar point.<br>- Before nouns, 的 (de) is used to markpossessionormodification. One way to think about 的 (de) is that it works like apostrophe-'s' in English.  Think of this one as the 'possessivede' or 'noun-modifyingde.'<br><ruby>小李的房子<rt>Xiǎo Lǐ de fángzi</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Li's house<br><hr><br>- This comparison works very well for possession, as it shows how English and Chinese handle possession in a similar way. Just remember that Chinese uses this 'possession' far more widely than English. Modifying, describing qualities, and assigning attributes are all handled in the same way as possession, by using 的 (de).<br>- Another way to use 的 (de) is as anattributive. It's just a way of connecting adjectives or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and the 的 (de) makes it clear that the extra information is connected to the noun.  Here's an example:<br><ruby>红色的自行车<rt>hóngsè de zìxíngchē</rt></ruby><br>red bicycle<br><hr><br>- Here 的 (de) is used to modify 'bicycle' with the color 'red.' It attributes the color 'red' to the 'bicycle.'<br>- Although certainly not complete for all uses, this simple structure should help as a general guideline:<br>- 的 + Noun<br><ruby>我的手机<rt>wǒ de shǒujī</rt></ruby><br>my cell phone<br><ruby>我们的老师<rt>wǒmen de lǎoshī</rt></ruby><br>our teacher<br><ruby>漂亮的衣服<rt>piàoliang de yīfu</rt></ruby><br>beautiful clothes<br><hr><br>- For you nerdier learners, 的 (de) is known to the Chinese as 白勺的 (bái-sháo de) as it's composed of the characters 白 (bái) and 勺 (sháo).<br>- Thisdeis probably the trickiest to crack for English speakers as it has no obvious equivalent in English.  得 (de) is used to construct various kinds ofcomplementsand is usually associated with verbs. You can think of it as the 'complementde.'<br>- Although certainly not complete for all uses, this simple structure should help:<br>- Verb + 得<br><ruby>做得很 好<rt>zuò de hěn hǎo</rt></ruby><br>do very well<br><ruby>说得太 快<rt>shuō de tài kuài</rt></ruby><br>speak too fast<br><ruby>玩得很 开心<rt>wán de hěn kāixīn</rt></ruby><br>play very happily<br><hr><br>- For you nerdier learners, 得 (de) is known as 双人得 (shuāngrén de), as the character component 彳 is often referred to as 双人 (shuāngrén), or the 'double person' component.<br>- You might be wondering how the examples using 得 (de) above are different from adverbs. That's actually a really good question, but it's one that you should defer until later in your studies.Complementsare a bit tricky, and you'll be learning a lot more about them at theintermediate level, so be patient!<br>- 地 (de) is used to turnadjectivesintoadverbs, and can be thought of as equivalent to thesuffix-lyin English.  You could call it the 'adverbde' or 'adverbialde,' since it precedesverbslike adverbs do.<br>- Although not complete for all uses, this simple structure should help:<br>- Adj. + 地 +  Verb<br>- Note that it's the 'adjective + 地 (de)' structure that makes the adjective into an 'adverb phrase' (called anadverbial). If it's a straight-up adverb you're using (instead of an adjective), then you don't need 地 (de) at all.<br>- This pattern is also the least common of the three; you'll be using 的 (de) and 得 (de) a lot more in everyday communication than this one.<br><ruby>生气地说<rt>shēngqì de shuō</rt></ruby><br>angrily say<br><ruby>开心地笑<rt>kāixīn de xiào</rt></ruby><br>happily laugh<br><ruby>慢慢地走<rt>mànmàn de zǒu </rt></ruby><br>slowly walk<br><hr><br>- Again, you don't have to know this, but this 地 (de) is known in Chinese as 土也地 (tǔ-yě de), as it's composed of the 土 (tǔ) component on the left with a 也 (yě) on the right.<br>- This example is naturally going to be a little more difficult than the ones above, since we're cramming all three usages into one sentence, but you may find this useful.<br><ruby>今天的作业 你 做得不好，因为 你 没 认真地听课。<rt>Jīntiān de zuòyè nǐ zuò de bù hǎo, yīnwèi nǐ méi rènzhēn de tīngkè.</rt></ruby><br>You didn't do today's homework well because you didn't listen attentively in class.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5MOMM		{}
Verb + 过 + 了<br>她 吃过了。		- Using 'guo' with 'le'<br>- You might be familiar withusing 过 (guo) to indicate that anaction has been experiencedin the past, but then also see it used together with了 (le).  What's going on here?  If you're already familiar with the basic usage of both 了 (le) and 过 (guo), then a special explanation of how they sometimes work together is now in order.<br>- Verb + 过 + 了<br>- You'll notice that this pattern is often used for everyday behaviors.  It's used for actions like 'eating' and 'brushing one's teeth' and 'taking a shower.'<br><ruby>她 吃过了。<rt>Tā chī guo le.</rt></ruby><br>She has eaten (already).<br><ruby>牙 刷过了。<rt>Yá shuā guo le.</rt></ruby><br>I've brushed my teeth (already).<br><ruby>洗过了。<rt>Xǐ guo le.</rt></ruby><br>I've showered (already).<br><hr><br>- For the examples above, you could have inserted an object to modify the basic pattern, getting this:<br>- Verb + 过 + Obj. + 了<br>- The object has been inserted in the sentences below:<br><ruby>你 吃过饭了吗？<rt>Nǐ chī guo fàn  le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Have you eaten (already)?<br><ruby>我 刷过牙了。<rt>Wǒ shuā guo yá  le.</rt></ruby><br>I have brushed my teeth (already).<br><ruby>他 洗过澡了。<rt>Tā xǐ guo zǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>He has showered (already).<br><hr><br>- You would be right to point out that 过 (guo) is mainly used to call attention to the fact that someonehas had anexperience.This is the basic pattern pointed out in the article on thebasic usage of the aspectual particle 过(guo).  In the examples above, though, it's not any 'once-in-a-lifetime'experiencesbeing expressed, it's more just the information that these actions aredone.Here, 过 (guo) and 了 (le) work together to emphasize that an action isalready done.This is why the translations on the side add the word 'already' in parentheses at the end; this is the feeling the sentences give you.  In fact, to emphasize the idea ofalready doneeven further, you could add the word for 'already,' 已经 (yǐjīng), before the verbs in the examples below, and it also works just fine:<br><ruby>她已经吃过饭了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng  chī guo fàn le.</rt></ruby><br>She has already eaten (a meal).<br><ruby>我已经刷过牙了。<rt>Wǒ yǐjīng  shuā guo yá le.</rt></ruby><br>I have already brushed my teeth.<br><ruby>他已经洗过澡了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng  xǐ guo zǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>He has already had a shower.<br><hr><br>- So when would you use the sentences above?  You'd be emphasizing that the action hasalreadyoccurred (so it doesn't need to be done again), so it would probably be something like this:<br>- For the eating example:<br>- For the tooth brushing example:<br>- For the taking a shower example:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGP69JD		{}
Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br>你比我 胖 。		- Basic comparisons with 'bi'<br>- One of the most common words whencomparingthings in Chinese is to use比 (bǐ). 比 (bǐ) has similarities to the English word 'than,' but it requires a word order that's not so intuitive, so you'll want to practice it quite a bit.<br>- You could think of 比 (bǐ) as meaning 'than,' except that it sits between the two things being compared.  Theword orderwill take a little getting used to, but aside from that, the pattern is quite easy.<br>- To say that one thing is moreadjectivethan another, the structure is:<br>- Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br>- The noun that's placed first is the one that comes out on top in the comparison. So in the sentence:<br><ruby>小李比小张高。<rt>Xiǎo Lǐ bǐ Xiǎo Zhāng gāo .</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Li is taller than Xiao Zhang.<br><hr><br>- 小李 (Xiǎo Lǐ) is taller. The same situation could be described as<br><ruby>小张比小李矮。<rt>Xiǎo Zhāng bǐ Xiǎo Lǐ ǎi .</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Zhang is shorter than Xiao Li.<br><hr><br><ruby>他比老师聪明。<rt>Tā bǐ lǎoshī cōngming.</rt></ruby><br>He is smarter than the teacher.<br><ruby>上海比纽约大吗 ？<rt>Shànghǎi bǐ Niǔyuē dà ma? </rt></ruby><br>Is Shanghai bigger than New York?<br><ruby>她比她 妈妈漂亮。<rt>Tā bǐ tā māma  piàoliang .</rt></ruby><br>She is prettier than her mother.<br><hr><br>- Try not to make these mistakes:<br>- 很 (hěn) can't used in the comparison.<br><hr><br>- The adjective used in the comparison should be positive, not negative.<br><hr><br>- 比 (bǐ) is not used with 一样 (yīyàng).  比 (bǐ) is used when two things arenotthe same.<br><hr><br>- This is a slight upgrade of the basic 比 (bǐ) comparison pattern, adding in更 (gèng) before the adjective. 更 (gèng) means 'even more,' so the idea is that while one thing is already quite [adjective], this other thing iseven more[adjective].  Pretty simple!<br>- Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + 更 + Adj.<br>- The only new thing here is the addition of 更 (gèng) before the adjective.<br><ruby>小李比小张更 高。<rt>Xiǎo Lǐ bǐ Xiǎo Zhāng gèng gāo .</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Li is even taller than Xiao Zhang.<br><hr><br>- The implication is that while Xiao Zhang istall, 小李 (Xiǎo Lǐ) iseven taller.<br><ruby>我 哥哥比我更 高。<rt>Wǒ gēge bǐ wǒ gèng gāo.</rt></ruby><br>My big brother is even taller than me.<br><ruby>你 男朋友比我男朋友更 帅。<rt>Nǐ nánpéngyou bǐ wǒ nánpéngyou gèng shuài.</rt></ruby><br>Your boyfriend is even more handsome than mine.<br><ruby>这里 的 冬天比纽约 的 冬天更 冷。<rt>Zhèlǐ de dōngtiān  bǐ Niǔyuē de dōngtiān gèng lěng.</rt></ruby><br>The winter here is even colder than it is in New York.<br><hr><br>- Check these other comparison patterns out as well:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8SI2K		{}
从⋯⋯到⋯⋯<br>从1 号到5 号 我 在 上海。		- Expressing 'from… to…' with 'cong… dao…'<br>- 从⋯⋯ 到⋯⋯(cóng... dào...) is used in the same way as 'from... to...' is used in English, and can be used both for times and places.<br>- To express from one time to another, the following structure is used:<br>- 从 + Time 1 + 到 + Time 2<br>- The 'time' here does not necessarily have to be a standard time word; it can be any event or action.<br><ruby>从2004 年到2008 年<rt>cóng èr-líng-líng-sì nián dào èr-líng-líng-bā nián</rt></ruby><br>from 2004 to 2008<br><ruby>从一号到五号 都 在 下雨。<rt>Cóng yī hào dào wǔ hào dōu zài xiàyǔ.</rt></ruby><br>From the first to the fifth, it's been raining non-stop.<br><ruby>老板从周二到周五 都 要 出差。<rt>Lǎobǎn cóng Zhōuèr dào Zhōuwǔ dōu yào chūchāi.</rt></ruby><br>From Tuesday until Friday the boss will go on a business trip.<br><hr><br>- Remember that there are two options for theword order of time words.<br>- The same structure can also be used to express 'from' one place 'to' another.<br>- 从 + Place 1 + 到 + Place 2<br><ruby>从南京 西 路到南京 东 路<rt>cóng Nánjīng Xī Lù dào  Nánjīng Dōng Lù</rt></ruby><br>from West Nanjing Road to East Nanjing Road<br><ruby>从酒店到机场 不太 远。<rt>Cóng jiǔdiàn dào jīchǎng bù tài yuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>From the hotel to the airport is not too far.<br><ruby>从上海到北京 要 几 个 小时。<rt>Cóng Shànghǎi dào Běijīng yào jǐ gè xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br>From Shanghai to Beijing it takes a few hours.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGGGIW8		{}
Noun 1 + 没(有) + Noun 2 + Adj.<br>你没有我 胖 。		- Basic comparisons with 'meiyou'<br>- In Chinese, there is another way to make comparisons. You can use没有 (méiyǒu)to express that something is 'not as'adjectiveas something else.  (Yes, that's the same 没有 (méiyǒu) that means 'not have,' used here in a different way.)<br>- As well as with比 (bǐ), you can also use 没有 (méiyǒu) to make basic comparisons. You could think of 没有 (méiyǒu) as the opposite of 比 (bǐ) - it works in the same way, but rather than expressing 'more... than...' it expresses 'not as... as...':<br>- Noun 1 + 没有 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br>- In this structure, the noun that's placed first isless'adjective' than the second noun, making 没有 (méiyǒu) theoppositeof比 (bǐ)for comparison purposes. So in the sentence:<br><ruby>小张没有小李 高 。<rt>Xiǎo Zhāng méiyǒu Xiǎo Lǐ gāo.</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Zhang is not as tall as Xiao Li.<br><hr><br>- 小李 (Xiǎo Lǐ) is taller. The same situation could be described as:<br><ruby>小李没有小张 矮 。<rt>Xiǎo Lǐ méiyǒu Xiǎo Zhāng ǎi.</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Li is not as short as Xiao Zhang.<br><hr><br><ruby>这 个 地方没有上海 好玩。<rt>Zhège dìfang méiyǒu Shànghǎi hǎowán.</rt></ruby><br>This place is not as fun as Shanghai.<br><ruby>火车没有飞机 快。<rt>Huǒchē méiyǒu fēijī kuài.</rt></ruby><br>Trains are not as fast as airplanes.<br><ruby>他没有他弟弟 聪明。<rt>Tā méiyǒu tā dìdi cōngming.</rt></ruby><br>He's not as smart as his younger brother.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEAH5M		{}
来 / 去 + Place<br>我来上海 一 年 了。		- Directional verbs 'lai' and 'qu'<br>- 来 (lái) and 去 (qù) are both words that help to express direction from the perspective of the speaker. 来 (lái) means 'come' (towards the speaker), while 去 (qù) means 'go' (away from the speaker). For example, if you are in China, a local person might ask you: 'When did you come to China?' using 来 (lái). Another example is if you want to go from China to Japan, your friends might ask you:  “When are you going to Japan?' using 去 (qù).<br>- Seems really easy, right? Well, learn them well now, because you'll get a lot of mileage out of these words in future grammar patterns.<br>- 来 / 去 + Place<br>- For the examples below, keep in mind that if the speaker uses 去 (qù), then she is not at the place mentionednow. If the speaker uses 来 (lái), she must already be at the place mentioned. Just stay consistent with this, and you're good.<br><ruby>妈妈 要去超市。<rt>Māma yào qù chāoshì.</rt></ruby><br>Mom will go to the supermarket.<br><ruby>老板 今天来公司 吗？<rt>Lǎobǎn jīntiān lái gōngsī ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is the boss coming into the office today?<br><ruby>你 现在来南京 路 吧。<rt>Nǐ xiànzài lái Nánjīng Lù ba.</rt></ruby><br>Come to Nanjing Road now.<br><hr><br>- 来 (lái) and  去 (qù) can both be paired with other simple verbs to demonstrate the direction an action has taken. For example, 进来 (jìnlai, 'come in'),  进去 (jìnqu, 'go in'),  出来 (chūlai, 'come out'),  出去 (chūqu, 'go out'), 回来 (huílai, 'come back'), 回去 (huíqu, 'go back'), etc.<br>- When you start tacking these two-character verbs onto the ends of other verbs, they are calleddirection complements, and are covered in detail in a more advanced article.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGRBKSL		{}
请 + Verb<br>请坐 。		- Polite requests with 'qing'<br>- To be more polite in English, we add the word 'please' onto our requests. In Chinese, the word 请 (qǐng) serves the same purpose.<br>- In its most simple form, a polite request can consist of only two words.<br>- 请 + Verb<br><ruby>请进 。<rt>Qǐng jìn.</rt></ruby><br>Please come in.<br><ruby>请坐 。<rt>Qǐng zuò.</rt></ruby><br>Please sit down.<br><ruby>请说 。<rt>Qǐng shuō.</rt></ruby><br>Please speak.<br><hr><br>- Obviously, those requests may be significantly longer.<br>- 请 (+ 你) + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>请喝 茶 。<rt>Qǐng hē chá.</rt></ruby><br>Please have some tea.<br><ruby>请不要 迟到 。<rt>Qǐng bùyào chídào.</rt></ruby><br>Please do not be late.<br><ruby>请尝 一 尝 。<rt>Qǐng cháng yī cháng.</rt></ruby><br>Please have a taste.<br><hr><br>- The phrase 请问 (qǐngwèn) is a set expression meaning not 'please ask,' but rather, 'may I ask.' It frequently comes before asking for directions or other polite requests for information.<br><ruby>请问 ， 洗手间 在 哪里 。<rt>Qǐng wèn, xǐshǒujiān zài nǎlǐ?</rt></ruby><br>Excuse me, where is the restroom?<br><hr><br>- You may have noticed that the Chinese themselves do not use 请 (qǐng) nearly as much as we use the word 'please' in English. It's not because Chinese people are rude; it's because the word 请 (qǐng) feels rather formal in Chinese, and most people don't feel the need to use it with family members, friends, or even co-workers.<br>- Here are some other ways to start make a request to still be polite, but less in a less formal way:<br><ruby>你可 不 可以…… ？<rt>Nǐ kě bu kěyǐ…?</rt></ruby><br>Could you...?<br><ruby>你能 不 能…… ？<rt>Nǐ néng bu néng…?</rt></ruby><br>Can you...?<br><ruby>麻烦你 ……<rt>Máfan nǐ…</rt></ruby><br>Can I trouble you to... (?)<br><hr><br>- Aside from this 'please' usage, the word 请 (qǐng) has some additional uses not covered here. It can mean 'to invite,' or 'to treat (someone to a meal),' and can even be used as acausative verb. None of those uses are covered here.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG25C48		{}
要 + Noun / 要 + Verb<br>我要一 杯 水。		- Auxiliary verb 'yao' and its multiple meanings<br>- You probably already know the basic meaning of要 (yào)as 'to want.'  It is actually a quite versatile word, though, and can also take on the meanings of 'to need' as well as 'will (do something).'  In every case, context is crucial for figuring out which meaning someone is trying to express.<br>- This structure could be used when ordering food at a restaurant or a shop. Here, it's being used for saying that you wantsomething.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Noun<br><ruby>你要什么？<rt>Nǐ yào shénme? </rt></ruby><br>What do you want? <br><ruby>我要一 杯 水。<rt>Wǒ yào yī bēi shuǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I want a cup of water.<br><ruby>你们 都要冰 可乐 吗？<rt>Nǐmen dōu yào bīng kělè ma? </rt></ruby><br>Do you all want coke with ice? <br><hr><br>- In Chinese, 要 (yào) can mean 'want to' (similar to想 (xiǎng)), but its tone is quite firm. So it's used for saying that you wantto dosomething.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb<br><ruby>你要喝 什么 酒？<rt>Nǐ yào hē shénme jiǔ? </rt></ruby><br>What kind of wine do you want to drink? <br><ruby>爸爸要买 一 个 新 手机。<rt>Bàba yào mǎi yī gè xīn shǒujī.</rt></ruby><br>Dad wants to buy a new cell phone.<br><ruby>我要跟 你 一起 去。<rt>Wǒ yào gēn nǐ yīqǐ qù.</rt></ruby><br>I want to go with you.<br><hr><br>- If you crank the urgency of 'to want' up a few notches, you get 'to need.'  The two meanings overlap, creating a fuzzy, 'needy' gray area.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb<br>- This use of 要 (yào) is like 'going to' (similar to会(huì)).<br>- Again, no change to the structure here, but it often includes a mention of a timewhensomething isgoing to happen.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb<br>- If you want to know more about the related pattern '要⋯⋯了' (yào... le), please seethe 'kuai... le' pattern.<br><ruby>星期五 我们要开会。<rt>Xīngqīwǔ wǒmen yào kāihuì.</rt></ruby><br>We are going to have a meeting on Friday.<br><ruby>12 点 我要去 吃饭。<rt>Shí'èr diǎn wǒ yào qù chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br>I am going to go eat at 12 o'clock.<br><ruby>老板 下周要出差 吗？<rt>Lǎobǎn xià zhōu yào chūchāi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is the boss going on a business trip next week?<br><hr><br>- You may have noticed that the meanings can easily overlap. To figure out what is intended, you need to use context.  How urgent is the situation?  Is it likely to be something the speaker reallywantsto do?  Is it something that's totallygoing tohappen, regardless of anyone's preference?  Most often, a little background knowledge and some common sense are all you need to figure it out.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG95AL1		{}
应该 / 该 + Verb<br>你应该工作。		- Expressing 'should' with 'yinggai'<br>- 应该 (yīnggāi) translates to the English word 'should,' and is an essential word to know for your conversaitonal Chinese. Youshoulddefinitely get comfortable using 应该 (yīnggāi) right away!<br>- Theauxiliary verb应该 (yīnggāi) is the most common way to express 'should' in Chinese. The structure is:<br>- Subj. + 应该 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>在 中国， 你应该喝 白酒。<rt>Zài Zhōngguó, nǐ yīnggāi hē báijiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>In China, you should drink baijiu.<br><ruby>我应该给 你 多少 钱？<rt>Wǒ yīnggāi gěi nǐ duōshao qián? </rt></ruby><br>How much money should I give you? <br><ruby>感冒 的 时候应该喝 热水。<rt>Gǎnmào de shíhou yīnggāi hē rè shuǐ.</rt></ruby><br>You should drink hot water when you have a cold.<br><hr><br>- Add thenegative adverb 不(bù) before 应该 (yīnggāi) to negate it.<br>- Subj. + 不 + 应该 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>你不 应该告诉 他。<rt>Nǐ bù yīnggāi gàosu tā.</rt></ruby><br>You should not tell him.<br><ruby>他不 应该打 人。<rt>Tā bù yīnggāi dǎ rén.</rt></ruby><br>He should not hit people.<br><ruby>我们不 应该迟到。<rt>Wǒmen bù yīnggāi chídào.</rt></ruby><br>We shouldn't be late.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGV01X9		{}
会 + Verb<br>明天 你会来 吗？		- Expressing 'will' with 'hui'<br>- 会 (huì) has multiple uses, but in this context, it is being used to express the possibility of an action happening in the future.<br>- As well asexpressing a learned skill, 会 (huì) can also be used to indicate that somethingwillhappen or that someonewilldo something.<br>- Subj. + 会 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>明天 你会来 吗 ？<rt>Míngtiān nǐ huì lái ma?</rt></ruby><br>Will you come tomorrow?<br><ruby>他会来 看 你 吗？<rt>Tā huì lái kàn nǐ ma?</rt></ruby><br>Will he come to see you?<br><ruby>明天会下雨 吗？<rt>Míngtiān huì xiàyǔ ma?</rt></ruby><br>Will it rain tomorrow?<br><hr><br>- Nothing new here.

想 + Verb<br>我想去。		- Expressing 'would like to' with 'xiang'<br>- If you want to express something that you 'would like to do,' 想 (xiǎng) will be a very helpful auxiliary verb to know. Although similar to 要 (yào), 想 (xiǎng) will give you another more tactful option when you want to articulate a desire.<br>- The verb 想 (xiǎng) can be used to express 'would like to.' In this case it's anauxiliary verb. The structure is:<br>- Subj. + 想 + Verb (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>你想去吗？<rt>Nǐ xiǎng qù ma? </rt></ruby><br>Would you like to go? <br><ruby>我想吃面。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng chī miàn.</rt></ruby><br>I would like to eat noodles.<br><ruby>你想喝水 吗？<rt>Nǐ xiǎng hē shuǐ ma? </rt></ruby><br>Would you like to drink some water? <br><hr><br>- No surprises here:use 不 (bù) to negate想 (xiǎng).<br>- Subj. + 不 + 想 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>他们不 想去 酒吧。<rt>Tāmen bù xiǎng qù jiǔbā.</rt></ruby><br>They wouldn't like to go to the bar.<br><ruby>你不 想认识 这个 美女 吗？<rt>Nǐ  bù xiǎng rènshi zhège měinǚ ma? </rt></ruby><br>Would you not like to know this beautiful lady? <br><ruby>我不 想回家。<rt>Wǒ bù xiǎng huíjiā.</rt></ruby><br>I wouldn't like to return home.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGT97VF		{}
(Verb Phrase 1) + (Verb Phrase 2)<br>我们去咖啡店喝咖啡 吧。		- Actions in a row<br>- Linking actions together in a sentence is very straightforward and to the point. Because of this, there is no new word or phrase needed!<br>- In Chinese, it's very easy to describe two actions in a row. Simply place oneverb phraseafter another, in this structure:<br>- Subj. + [Verb Phrase 1] + [Verb Phrase 2]<br>- No connecting word is needed. A common mistake in the early stages of learning Chinese is to try and link verbs with 和 (hé). This is incorrect;和 (hé) is for linking nouns. Just use one verb phrase after another and the sequence of events is clear.<br><ruby>我 要回家吃饭。<rt>Wǒ yào huíjiā chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br>I want to go home and eat.<br><ruby>你 要去超市买东西 吗？<rt>Nǐ yào qù chāoshì mǎi dōngxi ma? </rt></ruby><br>Are you going to the supermarket to buy things? <br><ruby>他 不 想去图书馆看书。<rt>Tā bù xiǎng qù túshūguǎn kàn shū.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't want to go to the library and read.<br><hr><br>- Note that the English translations of these sentences use the word 'and,' but there is no equivalent to it in Chinese.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPRGAX		{}
难 + Verb<br>难做。难买。		- Expressing 'difficult' with 'nan'<br>- 难 (nán) is an adjective that means 'difficult.' When something is 'hard to do' (as in difficult), the word 难 (nán) can be used before the verb.<br>- Just as 好 (hǎo) can be used to indicate that it'seasy to do something, 难 (nán) can be attached to verbs (with a few special exceptions), to indicate that something ishard to do.<br>- The structure is:<br>- Subj. + (很) 难 + Verb<br><ruby>这 句 话 很难 懂。<rt>Zhè jù huà hěn nán dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>This sentence is hard to understand.<br><ruby>汉语 很难 学。<rt>Hànyǔ hěn nán xué.</rt></ruby><br>Mandarin is hard to learn.<br><ruby>中国菜 很难 做。<rt>Zhōngguó cài hěn nán zuò.</rt></ruby><br>Chinese food is hard to make.<br><hr><br>- 难 (nán) can also be attached to 'sense verbs' (e.g. look, taste, smell, etc.) to indicate that something offers a 'bad sensory experience.'<br>- The structure is:<br>- Subj. + (很) 难 + [Sense Verb]<br><ruby>你 做 的 菜 很难吃。<rt>Nǐ zuò de cài hěn nánchī.</rt></ruby><br>The dishes you cook taste bad.<br><ruby>这里 的 咖啡 很难喝。<rt>Zhè lǐ de kāfēi hěn nánhē.</rt></ruby><br>The coffee here tastes bad.<br><ruby>这 首 歌 很难听。<rt>Zhè shǒu gē hěn nántīng.</rt></ruby><br>This song is terrible (hard to listen to).<br><hr><br>- Warning!If you're trying to say that a particular dish is 'difficult to eat,' don't use 难吃 (nánchī)! The word 难吃 (nánchī)onlymeans 'bad-tasting' andnot'difficult to eat.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG35T4H		{}
Verb + 了 + Duration<br>他 在 北京 住了 两 年。		- Expressing duration with 'le'<br>- Whether you need to express how long you lived somewhere, how long you studied astrophysics, or how long you worked as a mime, you'll need to use 了 (le) to express that time duration.<br>- Sayinghow longyou did somethingforin Chinese can seem tricky, as there is no preposition as in English. Instead it's all about word order:<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Duration + Obj.<br>- So 了 (le) is placed after the verb (to indicate thatthe action is completed), followed by the duration. This is how you talk about the duration of completed actions.<br><ruby>他 学 了一 年中文 。<rt>Tā xué le yī nián Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>He studied Chinese for a year.<br><ruby>我 看 了一 个 晚上书 。<rt>Wǒ  kàn le  yī gè wǎnshang shū.</rt></ruby><br>I read books all evening.<br><ruby>他 做 了八 年经理 。<rt>Tā zuò le bā nián jīnglǐ.</rt></ruby><br>He worked as a manager for eight years.<br><hr><br>- Also note that 的 can be used in this pattern, which must be placed between the duration and the object.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Duration + 的 + Obj.<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>我们 坐 了十五 个 小时的飞机 。<rt>Wǒmen zuò le  shíwǔ gè xiǎoshí de fēijī.</rt></ruby><br>We took a fifteen hour flight.<br><ruby>奶奶 看 了一 天的电视 。<rt>Nǎinai kàn le yī tiān de diànshì.</rt></ruby><br>Grandma watched TV all day.<br><ruby>妈妈 洗 了一 上午的衣服 。<rt>Māma xǐ le yī shàngwǔ de yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>Mom washed clothes all morning.<br><hr><br>- Note that the previous pattern can be used to express the duration of completed actionswhich are no longer in progress, although strictly speaking, it's not entirely clear if the actions are still ongoing or not.  To indicate that the actions are definitely concluded (not ongoing), atime wordmay be inserted into the sentence to indicate that you're talking about an event in the past:<br>- Subj. + [Time Word] + Verb + 了 + Duration + Obj.<br><ruby>孩子们 周六 写 了一天的作业 。<rt>Háizi men zhōuliù xiě le yī tiān de zuòyè.</rt></ruby><br>The kids did their homework all day Saturday.<br><ruby>我 刚才 打 了半 个 小时电话 。<rt>Wǒ gāngcái dǎ le bàn gè xiǎoshí diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>I was on the phone for half an hour.<br><ruby>我 昨天 玩 了一 晚上游戏 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān wán le yī wǎnshang yóuxì.</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday, I played games all evening.<br><hr><br>- To indicate that the action isdefinitely still in progress, use aslightly different pattern.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJ36VN		{}
从来 + 不 / 没(有) + Verb<br>她从来 不喝酒。我从来 没有去过美国。		- Expressing 'never' with 'conglai'<br>- Although it can also work in the positive, 从来 (cónglái) is usually used when you want to express that youneverdo something(as a habit, or as a rule), or that youhaveneverdone something(it's not a part of your life experience). In either usage, 从来 (cónglái) may be shortened to just 从 (cóng) in casual speech.<br>- When you follow 从来 (cónglái) with 不 (bù), you are expressing that youneverdo something(as a habit, or as a rule).  It's often used as a way to refuse something, as in 'I never drink.'<br>- The structure is:<br>- Subj. + 从来 + 不 + [Verb Phrase]<br>- Keep in mind that 从来 (cónglái) may be shortened to just 从 (cóng) in casual speech.<br>- Use 从来 (cónglái) with 没 (méi) or 没有 (méiyǒu) (and 过 (guo) after the verb) to indicate that youhaveneverdone something(it's not a part of your life experience).  You're talking about the past now, because you're talking about what you haven't done before, so 没有 (méiyǒu) is appropriate.  过 (guo) also makes sense, because you're making a statement about your life experience.<br>- The structure is:<br>- Subj. + 从来 + 没(有) + Verb + 过<br>- Again, 从来 (cónglái) may be shortened to just 从 (cóng) in casual speech. Note that you can have an object or other information after the verb, but the 过 (guo) needs to come immediately after the verb.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8NM5E		{}
Verb + 了 + Duration + 了<br>他 在 北京 住了 两 年 了。		- Expressing ongoing duration with double 'le'<br>- The 了 (le) particle is used in many different ways. In this article, we will explore how to use the double 了 (le) to express the duration of an activity that is ongoing.<br>- Expressinghow longyou did something in the pastis one thing, but what if the action is still ongoing?<br>- A clarifying example (in English) is appropriate:<br>- This article is about expressing the third situation above, the one which isdefinitely ongoing.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Duration + 了<br>- The first 了 (le) is placed after the verb (to indicate that the action is completed), followed by the duration, followed by an additional 了 (le) which tells us that the action has not concluded and is ongoing.  You can think of the second 了 (le) as communicating the meaning of 'up until now.'<br><ruby>你 睡了一 天了。<rt>Nǐ shuì le yī tiān le.</rt></ruby><br>You have been sleeping for the whole day.<br><ruby>他 在 北京 住了两 年了。<rt>Tā zài Běijīng zhù le liǎng nián le.</rt></ruby><br>He has been living in Beijing for two years.<br><ruby>这 个 会，他们 开了两 个 小时了。<rt>Zhège huì, tāmen kāi le liǎng gè xiǎoshí le.</rt></ruby><br>They've been holding this meeting for the past two hours.<br><hr><br>- Note that in the examples above, the verbs have no objects.

一起 + Verb<br>我们一起去 吧！要 不 要一起吃饭？		- Expressing 'together' with 'yiqi'<br>- If you want to express that you are doing somethingtogetherwith someone else, 一起 (yīqǐ) is your word!<br>- Note:The pinyin for 一起 is written 'yīqǐ' but pronounced 'yìqǐ' due to atone change rule.<br>- 一起 (yīqǐ) is the easiest way to express an action being done together with other people.<br>- Subj. + 一起 + Verb + Obj.<br>- The subject must be plural - a plural noun or two or more nouns linked with aconjunction. You can't do things together on your own, after all.<br><ruby>我们一起吃 晚饭 吧。<rt>Wǒmen yīqǐ chī wǎnfàn ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's eat dinner together.<br><ruby>早上 我 和 老公一起去 上班。<rt>Zǎoshang wǒ hé lǎogōng yīqǐ qù shàngbān.</rt></ruby><br>In the morning, I go to work together with my husband.<br><ruby>周末 我们一起去 看电影，好 吗？<rt>Zhōumò wǒmen yīqǐ qù  kàn diànyǐng, hǎo ma? </rt></ruby><br>Let's go to the movies this weekend, shall we? <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNVE15		{}
没办法 + Verb<br>我没 办法帮 你。		- Inability with 'mei banfa'<br>- If you are trying to express that something is impossible, you can use the phrase 没办法 (méi bànfǎ). 没办法 (méi bànfǎ) essentially means 'there is no way,' and while it works just fine by itself, it can also come beforeverbs.<br>- One easy way to express inability is to place the phrase 没办法 (méi bànfǎ) before the verb.<br>- Subj. + 没办法 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>今天 太 忙 了，中午没 办法出去 吃饭。<rt>Jīntiān tài máng le, zhōngwǔ méi bànfǎ chūqù chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br>It's too busy today.

Subj. + 在 + Place + Verb<br>我在上海 工作。		- Indicating location with 'zai' before verbs<br>- If you need to include the place where an action takes place, you can use 在 (zài). Just pay close attention toword order, as this is one case in which Chinese word order is quite different from English.<br>- To indicate the location that a verb takes place in, 在 (zài), followed by a location, comes before the verb.<br>- Subj. + 在 + Place + Verb + Obj.<br>- Notice that the location is placedbeforethe verb in Chinese, whereas in English it appearsafterwards.<br>- Remember: in English we usually put the location at the end of a sentence. In Chinese, we put the location after the subject butbeforethe verb.<br>- Rather than just using 在 (zài) to mean 'at' a location, you might want to use it to mean 'in,' 'on,' or 'under' a specific location. To do this, you'll need to add an extra word after the location. Learn aboutexpressing location with 'zai... shang / xia / li'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGX0Z0N		{}
Verb + Verb<br>你看看。		- Reduplication of verbs<br>- One of the fun things about Chinese is that when speaking, you can repeat a verb to express 'a little bit' or 'briefly.' This is calledreduplication. It creates a casual tone, and a sense that whatever the action is, it's not going to take long.<br>- In Chinese, verbs can bereduplicatedto indicate that they happen briefly or 'a little bit.'<br>- Subj. + Verb + Verb<br>- Chinese grammar books frequently refer to the reduplication of a single-character word as a 'AA' pattern. Note that for this pattern, the second verb's tone changes to the neutral tone.<br><ruby>你看看。<rt>Nǐ kànkan.</rt></ruby><br> Take a little look.<br><ruby>我试 试。<rt>Wǒ shìshi.</rt></ruby><br>I'll give it a try.<br><ruby>说 说你 的 想法。<rt>Shuōshuo nǐ de xiǎngfǎ.</rt></ruby><br>Talk a little bit about your ideas.<br><hr><br>- Another way to reduplicate verbs is to insert 一 (yī), in the following structure:<br>- Verb + 一 + Verb<br><ruby>别 生气 了，笑 一 笑！<rt>Bié shēngqì le, xiào yī xiào! </rt></ruby><br>Don't be mad, gimme a smile! <br><ruby>你 去问 一 问他们 厕所 在 哪里。<rt>Nǐ qù wèn yī wèn tāmen cèsuǒ zài nǎlǐ.</rt></ruby><br>Go and ask them where the bathroom is.<br><ruby>我 可以用 一 用你 的 电脑 吗？<rt>Wǒ kěyǐ yòng yī yòng nǐ de diànnǎo ma? </rt></ruby><br> Can I use your computer for a little bit? <br><hr><br>- Using this kind of structure lightens the mood and seriousness of the question. It also adds variety to sentence structure. Because these phrases are used colloquially, there is no set rule to which verbs this can be applied to. There are some verbs that are often reduplicated and some verbs that sound weird when reduplicated. With practice and exposure, you will learn which ones are often used.<br>- In the examples above, all verbs are only one syllable. Those verbs get reduplicated a lot, so those examples are quite useful. Occasionally, though, two-syllable verbs get reduplicated as well. When this happens, it's important to use the 'ABAB' pattern for verbs (meaning the entire word is repeated), and not the'AABB' pattern you use for adjectives(where each character is repeated individually).<br><ruby>考虑 考虑<rt>kǎolǜ kǎolǜ</rt></ruby><br>think it over<br><ruby>讨论 讨论<rt>tǎolùn tǎolùn</rt></ruby><br>discuss it<br><ruby>商量 商量<rt>shāngliang shāngliang</rt></ruby><br>talk it over<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGYC77J		{}
Verb + 在 + Place<br>我 住在北京。放在这里。		- Special cases of 'zai' following verbs<br>- When used to indicate locations of actions, 在 (zài) is usually placed after the subject andbefore the verb. There are certain cases, however, when 在 (zài) goes after the verb.<br>- This pattern is used regularly with special types of verbs, including: 住 (zhù), 放 (fàng), 坐 (zuò), and 站 (zhàn). These are verbs that imply movement or location. Technically, the structure is called alocation complement, but it can be understood without going into that much detail. Just remember that for verbs implyingmovementorlocationlike the ones above, thedefault sentence orderchanges and you get this structure:<br>- Subj. + [Special Verb] + 在 + Location<br><ruby>你 住在上海吗？<rt>Nǐ zhù zài Shànghǎi ma? </rt></ruby><br>Do you live in Shanghai? <br><ruby>他 坐在老板 的 旁边。<rt>Tā zuò zài lǎobǎn de pángbiān.</rt></ruby><br>He sits next to the boss.<br><ruby>你 应该 站在我 后面。<rt>Nǐ yīnggāi zhàn zài wǒ hòumiàn.</rt></ruby><br>You should stand behind me.<br><hr><br>- Remember that this is anexception to the normal rule. A common mistake is to over apply this and produce incorrect sentences. Note the incorrect and correct versions below.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG90DXK		{}
很 + Verb<br>我很喜欢 他。		- Special verbs with 'hen'<br>- Using 很 (hěn) to intensify verbs that express thoughts or feeling is really easy.<br>- Subj. + 很 + [Certain Verbs]<br>- Certain 'psychological verbs' related to feelings or emotional sates can be modified with 很 (hěn) to increase their intensity. This is similar to using 'really' or 'very much' in English. Remember that this only applies to psychological verbs, such as:<br><ruby>我很想你。<rt>Wǒ hěn xiǎng nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I really miss you.<br><ruby>他很喜欢你。<rt>Tā hěn xǐhuan nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>He really likes you.<br><ruby>你应该很小心。<rt>Nǐ yīnggāi hěn xiǎoxīn.</rt></ruby><br>You should be very careful.<br><hr><br>- Did you ever notice that some Chinese people with less-than-perfect English will use the phrase 'very like?'  Now you know why!	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGID0E8		{}
到 + Place<br>我到上海。		- Using 'dao' to mean 'to go to'<br>- A simple and direct way to indicate that you or someone is going to a specific place or has arrived at a specific place is to use the verb 到 (dào).<br>- The verb 到 (dào) is used to talk about arriving in places.<br>- Subj. + 到 + Place<br>- For these examples, it's straightforward to think of 到 (dào) as simply meaning 'to arrive.'<br><ruby>他们 已经到酒吧 了。<rt>Tāmen yǐjīng dào jiǔbā le.</rt></ruby><br>They have already arrived at the bar.<br><ruby>我 刚到家。<rt>Wǒ gāng dào jiā.</rt></ruby><br>I just got home.<br><ruby>你到机场 了 吗？<rt>Nǐ dào jīchǎng le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have you arrived at the airport?<br><hr><br>- In some examples translating 到 (dào) as 'to arrive' doesn't work as well and you might need to expand your understanding of exactly what 到 (dào) means. That's what we'll examine below.<br>- One commonly used structure takes the above one and adds a 来 (lái) or 去 (qù) to the end of the sentence.<br>- 到 + Place + 来 / 去<br><ruby>我 下午 在 家 ，你 可以到我家来。<rt>Wǒ xiàwǔ zài jiā, nǐ kěyǐ dào wǒ jiā lái.</rt></ruby><br>I'll be home this afternoon. You can come to my house.<br><ruby>老板 马上到办公室去。<rt>Lǎobǎn mǎshàng dào bàngōngshì qù.</rt></ruby><br>The boss is going to the office right now.<br><hr><br>- If you are going to a place to do something else, you can first use 到 (dào) to indicate where you're going, then add another verb after that. This has the meaning of 'going to the place to do something,' and it's one case where the 'arrive' translation doesn't really work anymore.<br>- Subj. + 到 + Place + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>明天 我 要到南京 路 买 衣服。<rt>Míngtiān wǒ yào dào Nánjīng Lù mǎi yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>Tomorrow I'll go to Nanjing Road to buy clothes.<br><ruby>你们 晚上到哪儿 吃饭 啊？<rt>Nǐmen wǎnshang dào nǎr chīfàn a?</rt></ruby><br>Where will you all go to eat food this evening?<br><ruby>我 跟 朋友 经常到KTV 唱歌 。<rt>Wǒ gēn péngyou jīngcháng dào KTV chànggē.</rt></ruby><br>I often go to Karaoke to sing songs with friends.<br><hr><br>- You might be wondering:can I just use 去 (qù) instead of 到 (dào)?For sentences like this,yes, you can.But native speakers will frequently use 到 (dào) in this way, so it's still good to be familiar with this pattern. If you want to sound more native, you should use it too!<br>- Sometimes it can be hard to figure out exactly which word to use in Chinese to mean 'go.' 到 (dào) is used when you talk aboutarrivingat a place, emphasizing the destination. 去 (qù) is used when you aregoing toa place. The exact meaning is 'to go,' and it emphasizesgetting tosomewhere. 走 (zǒu) is used when talking about 'leaving.' The emphasis is on gettingawayfrom a particular place.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLFX54		{}
好 + Verb<br>好做。好买。		- Using 'hao' to mean 'easy'<br>- Of course好 (hǎo)means 'good.' But it can also be used to express that something is 'easy to do' or 'good to do.' And it is quite...easy to do! All you need to do is place a 好 (hǎo) before averb.<br>- Just as 难 (nán) can be used to indicate that it'shard to do something, 好 (hǎo) can also come before verbs to indicate that something iseasy to do.<br>- The simple form is just:<br>- 好 + Verb<br>- If you want to make a sentence out of it:<br>- Subj. + (很) 好 + Verb<br><ruby>这 个 词 的 意思 很好懂。<rt>Zhège cí de yìsi hěn hǎo dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>The meaning of this word is easy to understand.<br><ruby>这 个 汉字 很好写。<rt>Zhège Hànzì hěn hǎo xiě.</rt></ruby><br>This Chinese character is easy to write.<br><ruby>三明治 很好做。<rt>Sānmíngzhì hěn hǎo zuò.</rt></ruby><br>Sandwiches are easy to make.<br><hr><br>- 好 (hǎo) can also be attached to 'sense verbs' (e.g. 'look,' 'taste,' 'smell,' etc.) to indicate that something isgoodto do(rather than 'easyto do').<br>- There's a limited number of these, but some of them are super common, so just memorize them as exceptions:<br><ruby>好吃<rt>hǎochī</rt></ruby><br>good to taste, good to eat, delicious<br><ruby>好喝<rt>hǎohē</rt></ruby><br>good to taste, good to drink<br><ruby>好看<rt>hǎokàn </rt></ruby><br>good to look at, good-looking, attractive<br><hr><br>- The word for 'fun' in Chinese is also of this form, even though it's not a sense verb:<br><ruby>好玩<rt>hǎowán</rt></ruby><br>fun<br><hr><br><ruby>这 首 歌 很好听。<rt>Zhè shǒu gē hěn hǎotīng.</rt></ruby><br>This song is great.<br><ruby>这 种 茶 很好闻。<rt>Zhè zhǒng chá hěn hǎowén.</rt></ruby><br>This kind of tea smells good.<br><ruby>你 的 新 包 很好看。<rt>Nǐ de xīn bāo hěn hǎokàn.</rt></ruby><br>Your new bag looks good.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJQU93		{}
Verb + 一下<br>你看 一下。		- Verbing briefly with 'yixia'<br>- After briefly reading this article, you will know how to use 一下 (yīxià) to express a brief action!<br>- Note:The pinyin for 一下 is written 'yīxià' but pronounced 'yíxià' due to atone change rule.<br>- To express that a verb is carried out briefly or 'a little bit,' you can add 一下 (yīxià) after it. Sometimes 一下 (yīxià) can soften the tone.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 一下 + Obj.<br>- Often, adding 一下 (yīxià) just makes the Chinese feel more natural.  This is not something you can get a feel for quickly.  You'll want to observe how native speakers use 一下 (yīxià)  over a long period of time to really get used to how it is used.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWCESP		{}
Subj. + Verb + Indirect Obj. + Direct Obj.<br>我问了 老师 一 个 问题。		- Verbs that take double objects<br>- There are some common verbs in Chinese that can take two objects. In this article, we will look at how they are used.<br>- As in English, some verbs in Chinese take two objects. A typical example for English is 'to bake someone a cake,' and there are countless more. The structure in Chinese is:<br>- Subj. + Verb + [Indirect Obj.] + [Direct Obj.]<br>- If you don't know what direct and indirect objects are, don't worry; the terms can be thought of as 'object 1' and 'object 2.' The main point is that there are two of them, and the first one is the recipient (e.g. the person the cake is given to), while the second one is the thing that the action happens to (e.g. the cake that gets baked).<br><ruby>老师，我 可以问你一 个问题吗？<rt>Lǎoshī, wǒ  kěyǐ wèn nǐ yī gè wèntí ma?</rt></ruby><br>Teacher, may I ask you a question?<br><ruby>大家 都叫他“怪叔叔”。<rt>Dàjiā dōu jiào  tā 'guài shūshu.'</rt></ruby><br>Everyone calls him 'Uncle Weirdo.'<br><ruby>我 想告诉你一 个 好消息。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng gàosu  nǐ yī gè hǎo xiāoxi.</rt></ruby><br>I want to tell you the good news.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGI2OAG		{}
Verb + 不懂<br>我 听不懂。		- Potential complement '-bu dong' for not understanding<br>- Chinese learners often have to express that they don't understand something, especially in the beginning when they start learning. One of the ways to express that is to use the 不懂 (bù dǒng) verb complement.<br>- Yes, 不懂 (bù dǒng) by itself simply means 'not understand,' and you can use it this way. But you'll find that more often, it follows a verb. When used this way, it is acomplement.<br>- Thepotential complement不懂 (bù dǒng) is used to talk about things that can't be understood. Note that this is aboutpotential: the subject doesn't have theabilityto understand.<br>- Subj. +  Verb + 不懂<br>- The 不懂 (bù dǒng) may also be swapped out with 不明白 (bù míngbai).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8R2V8		{}
Verb + 到 / 见<br>听到了 吗 ？		- Result complements '-dao' and '-jian'<br>- Two of the most common result complements in Chinese are 到 (dào) and 见 (jiàn). On this page we're only going to be talking about verbs related to the senses ('see,' 'hear,' etc.), and for this usage, the two are interchangeable.<br>- Result complementsare a huge topic in Chinese grammar, but you can approach them in stages. The structure you come across the most is a verb with 到 (dào):<br>- Subj. + Verb + 到 + Obj.<br>- What 到 (dào) does is indicate that the outcome of the verb is achieved - what itsresultis. Without a result complement, the sentence would describe only the action itself. To illustrate, 看 (kàn) 'to look' is the action of turning your head in a particular direction and focusing your eyes, whereas 看到 (kàndào), 'to see,' is the result of your brain taking in the visual input. It may sound a little hokey, but it really is possible to 'look but not see,' and Chinese makes a clear distinction between the action and the result.<br>- The complement 见 (jiàn) is very similar to 到 (dào), and it is used in the same way:<br>- Subj. + Verb + 见 + Obj.<br>- However, there is a difference.  见 (jiàn) is generallyonlyused after verbs involving one of the senses, like 听 (tīng) and 看 (kàn), whereas 到 (dào) can be attached to a large variety of verbs, which we will discussat a higher level later.<br><ruby>你看见那 个 帅哥 了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ kànjiàn nàge shuàigē le ma?</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>你看到那 个 帅哥 了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ kàndào nàge shuàigē le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you see that handsome guy?<br><hr><br><ruby>你听见了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ tīngjiàn le ma?</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>你听到了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ tīngdào le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you hear it?<br><hr><br>- Subj. + 没 + Verb + 到 / 见 + Obj.<br>- This structure can be negated using 没 (méi) on 没有 (méiyǒu). This is because if there is a result, then it already happened. And you need touse 没 (méi) to negate past events, not 不 (bù).<br><ruby>你没看到那 个 帅哥 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ méi kàndào nàge shuàigē ma?</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>你没看见那 个 帅哥 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ méi kànjiàn nàge shuàigē ma?</rt></ruby><br>You didn't see that handsome guy?<br><hr><br><ruby>你没听到吗 ？<rt>Nǐ méi tīngdào ma?</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>你没听见吗 ？<rt>Nǐ méi tīngjiàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>You didn't hear it?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWNGEP		{}
Verb + 完 (+ 了)<br>我 说完了。		- Result complement '-wan' for finishing<br>- On its own, 完 (wán) means 'to finish' or 'to complete.' Using it in this grammar structure, it expresses the idea of doing some action to completion.<br>- As well as with到 (dào) and 见 (jiàn), you can also formresult complementswith 完 (wán). This indicates that an action is finished or completed.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 完<br><ruby>我们 明天 可以 做完。<rt>Wǒmen míngtiān kěyǐ zuò wán.</rt></ruby><br>We can finish doing it tomorrow.<br><ruby>你 能 吃完吗 ？<rt>Nǐ néng chī wán ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you finish eating all?<br><ruby>我 今天 要 写完。<rt>Wǒ jīntiān yào xiě wán.</rt></ruby><br>I need to finish writing it today.<br><hr><br>- Frequently, you'll also see a 了 (le) at the end,indicating completion.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 完 + 了<br><ruby>我 说完了。<rt>Wǒ shuō wán le.</rt></ruby><br>I am finished talking.<br><ruby>你 吃完了吗 ？<rt>Nǐ chī wán le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you done eating?<br><ruby>我 看完了 。<rt>Wǒ kàn wán le.</rt></ruby><br>I have finished watching it.<br><hr><br>- If there is an object followed by the verb, 完 must be placed between the verb and the object. To indicate completion, 了 usually goes after the object.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 完 + Obj. + 了<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>我 做完作业了。<rt>Wǒ zuò wán zuòyè le.</rt></ruby><br>I finished doing my homework.<br><ruby>老板 开完会了。<rt>Lǎobǎn kāi wán huì le.</rt></ruby><br>The boss finished having the meeting.<br><ruby>我 看完这本书了。<rt>Wǒ kàn wán zhè běn shū le.</rt></ruby><br>I finished reading this book.<br><hr><br>- In English we say 'I finished the movie,' or 'I finished supper,' but in Chinese you should explicitly use the verb implied in English along with 完了 (wán le) to emphasize that you completed the action: 'watch the movie (till the end)' or 'eat (all my) supper.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNQUC1		{}
一些 + Noun<br>这里 有一些咖啡。		- Expressing 'some' with 'yixie'<br>- In order to express 'some' or 'a few,' you can use 一些 (yīxiē). To use it in this way, 一些 (yīxiē) is placed before the noun it modifies. 一些 (yīxiē) can modify the subject or the object.<br>- Note:The pinyin for 一些 is written 'yīxiē' but pronounced 'yìxiē' due to atone change rule.<br>- 一些 + Noun<br><ruby>妈妈 去 超市 买 了一些水果。<rt>Māma qù chāoshì mǎi le yīxiē shuǐguǒ.</rt></ruby><br>Mom went to the supermarket and bought some fruit.<br><ruby>上 个 周末 他 买了一些衣服。<rt>Shàng gè zhōumò tā mǎi le yīxiē yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>He bought some clothes last weekend.<br><ruby>我们 很 快 会 见到一些新 同事。<rt>Wǒmen hěn kuài huì jiàndào yīxiē xīn tóngshì.</rt></ruby><br>We're going to meet some new co-workers very soon.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWVZ0T		{}
有的 + Noun<br>派对的时候，有的人在喝酒，有的人在跳舞，还有的人在聊天。		- Using 'youde' to mean 'some'<br>- To refer to justcertainmembers of group, you can use 有的 (yǒude). This usage is normally translated as 'some' in English. It is often used multiple times in one sentence to refer to different groups.<br>- All you need to do is put 有的 (yǒude) before the nouns there are 'some of' in the sentence. If there is already some context, you can omit the subject, and the 有的 (yǒude) can just mean 'some' instead of 'some of something.'<br>- 有的 + (Subj.) + Predicate， 有的 + (Subj.) + Predicate<br>- Also, you aren't limited to just two 有的 (yǒude) in the sentence. You can have multiple groups doing different things, and just precede them with a 有的 (yǒude) each time.<br><ruby>外国人有的很 有钱，有的没钱。<rt>Wàiguó rén yǒude hěn yǒuqián, yǒude méi qián.</rt></ruby><br>Some foreigners are rich, but some aren't.<br><ruby>我们 公司 有 一些 电脑，有的是 新的，有的是 旧的。<rt>Wǒmen gōngsī yǒu yīxiē diànnǎo, yǒude shì xīn de, yǒude shì jiù de.</rt></ruby><br>Our company has some computers.

Number + 块 / 元 (+ Number + 毛 / 角) (+ 钱)<br>给 你 五块三毛。		- Counting money<br>- Cash is king, even though China is now crazy for mobile payments. Either way, though, mastering how to say quantities of money is vital!<br>- Before you learn how to count money in Chinese, make sure you know how to ask 'how much money' when you go shopping in China.<br>- Subj. + 多少钱 ?<br><ruby>多少 钱？<rt>Duōshao qián? </rt></ruby><br>How much?<br><ruby>你 的 手机多少 钱？<rt>Nǐ de shǒujī duōshao qián? </rt></ruby><br>How much was your cell phone?<br><ruby>我们 的 午饭多少 钱？<rt>Wǒmen de wǔfàn duōshao qián? </rt></ruby><br>How much is our lunch?<br><hr><br>- Chinese has a specific structure for talking about quantities for money:<br>- Number + 块 + Number + 毛<br><ruby>两块五毛<rt>liǎng kuài wǔ máo</rt></ruby><br>two kuai five mao (2.5)<br><ruby>三块八毛<rt>sān kuài bā máo</rt></ruby><br>three kuai eight mao (3.8)<br><ruby>十块两毛<rt>shí kuài liǎng máo</rt></ruby><br>ten kuai two mao (10.2)<br><hr><br>- Note that '2.5 RMB' reads as 两块五 (liǎng kuài wǔ).<br><hr><br>- If the smaller units are only in tens, you can just say the number of tens. So '3.8 RMB' is 三块八 (sān kuài bā). This way of giving the price is normally only used for amounts under 100 RMB.<br>- When the smallest unit is 2, it reads as 二 (èr) instead of 两 (liǎng).<br><hr><br>- The first number is the amount of whole RMB (or dollars etc.), and the second is the amount smaller units (e.g. cents).

More formally you can use 元 (yuán) in exactly the same way. This is similar to the difference between 'dollars' and 'bucks' in American English, or 'pounds' and 'quid' in British English. 块 (kuài) is appropriate in more situations than 'bucks' or 'quid,' though.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGL6JOE		{}
每 + Measure Word (+ Noun)<br>每个 人。每天。		- Expressing 'every' with 'mei'<br>- In this article we will look at the structure for saying 'every' in Chinese, which is slightly more involved than just throwing in the word 每 (měi).<br>- The pronoun 每 (měi) covers the meanings of 'each' and 'every.' It should normally be used with ameasure wordandused with 都 (dōu)in a complete sentence.<br>- 每 + Measure Word + Noun + 都<br>- Note that there are some words that don't use measure words because they themselves are already measure words. For example: 天 (tiān), 年 (nián), 周 (zhōu), 次 (cì) etc.<br><ruby>每个 菜都好吃。<rt>Měi gè cài dōu hěn hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>Every dish is delicious.<br><ruby>你每个 人都认识 吗？<rt>Nǐ měi gè rén dōu rènshi ma? </rt></ruby><br>Do you know every person? <br><ruby>老板每个 月都出差。<rt>Lǎobǎn měi gè yuè dōu chūchāi.</rt></ruby><br>The boss goes on business trips every month.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGB6L4M		{}
Number + Measure Word + 半 + Noun<br>三 个半小时		- Expressing 'half' with 'ban'<br>- The Chinese word 半 (bàn) means 'half.' That's simple enough, but what can get slightly tricky is the rules for how it combines withmeasure words.<br>- You'll need to use ameasure word(Measure Word) in this structure.<br>- 半 + Measure Word + Noun<br>- Themeasure wordsare also indicated below.<br><ruby>半个小时<rt>bàn gè xiǎoshí</rt></ruby><br>half an hour<br><ruby>半个月<rt>bàn gè yuè</rt></ruby><br>half a month<br><ruby>半碗米饭<rt>bàn wǎn mǐfàn</rt></ruby><br>half a bowl of rice<br><hr><br>- When it's more than just a half, then 半 (bàn) comes after themeasure wordinstead of before.

Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>一个人。一杯水。		- Measure words for counting<br>- Chinese usesmeasure words, a type of word calledclassifiersin linguistics which are common in East Asian languages. Measure words have a number of important uses, but one of the first ways you'll need to use them is for counting. Chinese learners should master them, starting with the measure word 个 (gè).<br>- Whenever you talk about the quantity of something in Chinese, you need ameasure word.<br>- Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>- English does actually have measure words, it's just that most nouns usually don't need them. In English, most nouns arecount nouns- they specify one instance of something. 'An apple,' for example. Some nouns aremass nounsand refer to something without specifying how much of it there is. Examples are 'furniture,' 'paper,' 'water,' etc. You can't say 'a furniture'; you need a measure word: 'apieceof furniture,' 'twosheetsof paper,' 'threeglassesof water,' and so on.<br>- In Chinese,allnouns aremass nounsso they all need measure words. Just as in English, different nouns are associated with different measure words (e.g. it wouldn't make sense to talk about 'a glass of furniture' unless something went horribly wrong in the factory).<br><ruby>一个人<rt>yī gè rén</rt></ruby><br>a person<br><ruby>两只猫<rt>liǎng zhī māo</rt></ruby><br>two cats<br><ruby>三条鱼<rt>sān tiáo yú</rt></ruby><br>three fish<br><hr><br>- Also remember that there isn't a one-to-one relationship between nouns and measure words.

几 + Measure Word (+ Noun) ?<br>几个人？		- Measure words in quantity questions<br>- Quantity questions are phrases for asking questions like 'how much?' or 'how many?'  You'll need to use thequestion word几 (jǐ) withmeasure wordsfor this.<br>- You can use the quantityquestion word几 (jǐ) instead of a number to ask about quantity withmeasure words.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 几 + Measure Word + Noun？<br><ruby>他 有几个 孩子？<rt>Tā yǒu jǐ gè háizi?</rt></ruby><br>How many kids does he have?<br><ruby>你 家 有几个 房间？<rt>Nǐ jiā yǒu jǐ gè fángjiān?</rt></ruby><br>How many rooms are there in your house?<br><ruby>他们 在 这里 住几个 星期？<rt>Tāmen zài zhèlǐ zhù jǐ gè xīngqī?</rt></ruby><br>How many weeks are they staying here?<br><hr><br>- When the number is not certain but you assume it's definitely more than ten, it's better to ask the question with 多少 (duōshao) instead of 几 (jǐ).<br>- Subj. + Verb + 多少 + Measure Word + Noun ？<br><ruby>你 去 过多少个 国家？<rt>Nǐ qù guo duōshao gè guójiā?</rt></ruby><br>How many countries have you been to?<br><ruby>你们 班 有多少个 学生？<rt>Nǐmen bān yǒu duōshao gè xuéshēng?</rt></ruby><br>How many students are there in your class?<br><ruby>你 大学 的 时候 看 了多少本 书？<rt>Nǐ dàxué de shíhou kàn le duōshao běn shū?</rt></ruby><br>How many books did you read when you were in college? <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGL9KQM		{}
这 / 那 + Measure Word (+ Noun)<br>那个人。这杯水。		- Measure words with 'this' and 'that'<br>- In English, when you refer to 'this table' or 'that girl' you only need two words: 'this' or 'that' plus the noun you're referring to.  In Chinese, though, you also need ameasure wordin the middle between the two.  In the very beginning you can get away with using个 (gè)for everything, but pretty soon you're going to have to start using other measure words in these simple phrases.<br>- If you use 这 (zhè) or 那 (nà) before a noun, you also need to include ameasure wordbefore the noun.<br>- 这 / 那 + Measure Word + Noun<br>- Note: In this usage, the tone of 个 (gè) tends to soften, so it's represented below as a neutral tone.<br><ruby>那个人<rt> nàge rén</rt></ruby><br>that person<br><ruby>这本书<rt> zhè běn shū</rt></ruby><br>this book<br><ruby>那件事<rt> nà jiàn shì</rt></ruby><br>that matter (in the sense of business, affair, or thing)<br><hr><br>- Although we didn't get into it here, the same pattern holds true when you use 哪 (nǎ) to ask 'which?'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGZC42B		{}
第 + Number (+ Measure Word)<br>你 是 我 的第 一个朋友。		- Ordinal numbers with 'di'<br>- We use ordinal numbers to express things like 'number one' or 'second,' so mastering them in Chinese is important. Fortunately, they are also very easy to learn by just adding the prefix 第 (dì).<br>- In English, there are four different suffixes for ordinal numbers:-st,-nd,-rdand-th. Chinese makes things a lot simpler by using one prefix for all ordinal numbers: 第 (dì). This character is simply placed in front of the number:<br>- 第 + Number<br>- You can also add in ameasure wordand anounto make the structure a bit fuller.<br>- 第 + Number + Measure Word + Noun<br><ruby>我 是第 一个到 公司 的 人。<rt>Wǒ shì dì-yī gè dào gōngsī de rén.</rt></ruby><br>I'm the first person that came to the office.<br><ruby>他 要 坐 早上第 一班地铁 去 上班。<rt>Tā yào zuò zǎoshang dì-yī  bān dìtiě qù shàngbān.</rt></ruby><br>He needs to take the first train in the morning to go to work.<br><ruby>小李 是 她 的第 三个男朋友。<rt>Xiǎo Lǐ shì tā de dì-sān gè nánpéngyou.</rt></ruby><br>Little Li is her third boyfriend.<br><hr><br>- Note that there are some words that don't use measure words because they themselves are already measure words. For example: 天 (tiān), 年 (nián), 周 (zhōu), 次 (cì), etc.<br><ruby>第 一天，我们 在 宾馆 里。<rt>Dì-yī tiān, wǒmen zài bīnguǎn lǐ.</rt></ruby><br>On the first day, we will be in the hotel.<br><ruby>来 上海 以后 的第 二年，他 开 了 这 家 公司。<rt>Lái Shànghǎi yǐhòu de dì-èr nián,  tā kāi le zhè jiā gōngsī.</rt></ruby><br>He started this company his second year after coming to Shanghai.<br><ruby>下 个 月 的第 一周老板 要 出差。<rt>Xià gè yuè de dì-yī zhōu , lǎobǎn yào chūchāi.</rt></ruby><br>The boss needs to go on a business trip the first week of next month.<br><hr><br>- Note that some nouns can form ordinals without 第 (dì). With these, the number can be used directly. For example, 七楼 (qī lóu) is 'the seventhfloor,' even though there is no 第 (dì).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGK904U		{}
⋯⋯怎么样？<br>你 最近怎么样？		- Asking how something is with 'zenmeyang'<br>- You may know that怎么 (zěnme) can mean 'how', but by adding to it and making it 怎么样 (zěnmeyàng), you can askhow something is, orwhat it is like. This is useful in all manner of conversations, and is essential for building conversation skills.<br>- This question form is super simple. It is similar to asking  the question, 'how is...?'<br>- Subj. + 怎么样 ?<br>- Many of these sample sentences are super common in everyday life, so it's a good idea to get familiar with them.<br><ruby>你 最近怎么样？<rt>Nǐ zuìjìn zěnmeyàng ? </rt></ruby><br>How have you been recently?<br><ruby>中国怎么样？<rt>Zhōngguò zěnmeyàng ? </rt></ruby><br>How is China?<br><ruby>北京 冬天怎么样？<rt>Běijīng dōngtiān zěnmeyàng ? </rt></ruby><br>How is Beijing in the winter?<br><hr><br>- In this pattern,  you're directly asking for an opinion in an open-ended way.<br>- 你 觉得 + Topic + 怎么样 ?<br>- This is like asking, 'what do you think of...?'<br><ruby>你 觉得上海怎么样？<rt>Nǐ juéde Shànghǎi  zěnmeyàng ? </rt></ruby><br>What do you think of Shanghai?<br><ruby>你 觉得我怎么样？<rt>Nǐ juéde  wǒ zěnmeyàng ? </rt></ruby><br>What do you think of me?<br><ruby>你 觉得中文怎么样？ 难学 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ juéde Zhōngwén zěnmeyàng?

怎么⋯⋯？<br>你怎么没 来？		- Asking why with 'zenme'<br>- Aside fromjust meaning 'how,'怎么 (zěnme) can also be used to ask 'why' or 'how come.'<br>- Similar to the question word为什么(wèishénme), questions can also be asked with 怎么 (zěnme).<br>- Subj. + 怎么 + Verb + Obj. ?<br>- This has similar connotations to saying 'how come' in English. It not only asks why, but expresses some surprise at the situation, and in some cases even disagreement with it.<br><ruby>他怎么还 没 来 ？<rt>Tā zěnme hái méi lái? </rt></ruby><br>How come he's not here yet?<br><ruby>你们怎么打 人？<rt>Nǐmen zěnme dǎ rén? </rt></ruby><br>How can you hit people? <br><ruby>他 帮 了 你，你怎么不 说 “谢谢” ？<rt>Tā bāng le nǐ, nǐ zěnme bù shuō 'xièxie'? </rt></ruby><br>He helped you.

How come you're not happy? <br><hr><br>- One pattern this use of 怎么 (zěnme) frequently appears in is with 这么 (zhème) or 那么 (nàme). (For more on 这么 (zhème) and 那么 (nàme), seeadjectives with 'name' and 'zheme.')<br>- Subj. + 怎么 + 这么 / 那么 + Adj.<br>- This use of 怎么 (zěnme) could be translated as either 'how' or 'why'; the actual meaning sort of falls in the fuzzy region between the two.  In any case, it's used to express disbelief:how can (something) be so (adjective)?!<br><ruby>他怎么那么 懒？<rt>Tā zěnme nàme lǎn? </rt></ruby><br>How can he be this lazy? <br><ruby>昨天怎么那么 冷？<rt>Zuótiān zěnme nàme lěng? </rt></ruby><br>How could it be so cold yesterday? <br><ruby>这些人怎么这么 吵？<rt>Zhèxiē rén zěnme zhème chǎo? </rt></ruby><br>How can these people so loud? <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD7NS3		{}
Verb + 了 + 吗？<br>你 吃饭了 吗？		- Questions with 'le ma'<br>- Asking questions about completed actions will involve using both 了 (le) and 吗 (ma). These are simply added to the end of a sentence or statement. Just make sure that 了 (le) comes first, followed by 吗 (ma).<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. + 了吗?<br>- Note the order of 了 (le) and 吗 (ma).<br><ruby>你 吃饭了 吗？<rt>Nǐ chīfàn le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Did you eat? <br><ruby>老板 走了 吗？<rt>Lǎobǎn zǒu le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Did the boss leave? <br><ruby>你男朋友 找到 新 工作了 吗？<rt>Nǐ nánpéngyou zhǎodào xīn gōngzuò le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Has your boyfriend found a new job yet? <br><hr><br>- Topic (+ Subj.) + Verb + 了吗?<br>- NOTE: in this structure, the topic is also the object for the verb.<br><ruby>晚饭 你 吃了 吗？<rt>Wǎnfàn nǐ chī le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Did you eat dinner? <br><ruby>衣服 你 洗 好了 吗？<rt>Yīfu nǐ xǐ hǎo le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Have you finished washing the clothes? <br><ruby>作业 你 写 完了 吗？<rt>Zuòyè nǐ xiě wán  le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Have you finishing doing homework? <br><hr><br>- Finally, please note that this pattern is nothing more than the combination of theexpressing completion with 'le'pattern and theyes/no questions with 'ma'pattern.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGYKDNF		{}
因为⋯⋯ 所以⋯⋯<br>因为饿 了，所以吃饭。		- Cause and effect with 'yinwei' and 'suoyi'<br>- You will often come across 因为⋯⋯所以⋯⋯ (yīnwèi... suǒyǐ...) in both written and spoken Chinese. This pattern will give your Chinese a clear logical structure, and can help make you more persuasive.<br>- A common way to explain causes in Chinese is with 因为 (yīnwèi). This is equivalent to 'because' in English. Usually 因为 (yīnwèi) will begin a new phrase in a sentence.<br>- In this structure, we first state the result, and then give the reason in the next statement after the 因为 (yīnwèi).<br>- Result, 因为 + Reason<br><ruby>他 学 得 很 快 ，因为他 很 聪明 。<rt>Tā xué de hěn kuài, yīnwèi tā hěn cōngming.</rt></ruby><br>He learns fast because he is smart.<br><ruby>我 爱 吃 四川 菜 ，因为很 辣 。<rt>Wǒ ài chī Sìchuān cài, yīnwèi hěn là.</rt></ruby><br> I love eating Sichuan food because it's very spicy.<br><ruby>我 在 学习 中文 ，因为我 想 去 中国 。<rt>Wǒ zài xuéxí Zhōngwén, yīnwèi wǒ xiǎng qù Zhōngguó.</rt></ruby><br>I am studying Chinese because I want to go to China.<br><hr><br>- Just as 因为 (yīnwèi) can be used to explain causes, 所以 (suǒyǐ) can be used to explain results. This is the equivalent of 'so…' or 'therefore…' in English.<br>- This pattern is similar to the expression using both 因为 (yīnwèi) and 所以 (suǒyǐ), but it leaves out the beginning 因为 (yīnwèi). This structure is more informal.<br>- Reason, 所以 + Result<br><ruby>汉字 太 难 了，所以我 不 想 学 。<rt>Hànzì tài nán le, suǒyǐ wǒ bù xiǎng xué.</rt></ruby><br>Chinese characters are too hard, so I don't want to study them.<br><ruby>她 很 漂亮，所以很 多 男孩 喜欢 她。<rt>Tā hěn piàoliang, suǒyǐ hěn duō nánhái xǐhuan tā.</rt></ruby><br>She is beautiful, so a lot of boys like her.<br><ruby>他 找到 工作 了，所以很 高兴。<rt>Tā zhǎodào gōngzuò le, suǒyǐ hěn gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>He found a job so he's happy.<br><hr><br>- The full pattern 因为……所以…… (yīnwèi... suǒyǐ...) is used to clearly indicate cause and effect. They could be thought of as equating to: 'Since ___ happened, so ___ happened.' It sounds weird to use both 'since' and 'so' in one sentence in English, but it makes everything crystal clear in Chinese.<br>- 因为 + Cause, 所以 + Effect<br>- This expresses that because ofcause, therefore there is aresult.<br><ruby>因为我 有 一个 中国 女朋友，所以我 要 学 中文。<rt>Yīnwèi wǒ yǒu yī gè Zhōngguó nǚpéngyou, suǒyǐ wǒ yào xué Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>Since I have a Chinese girlfriend, I need to study Chinese.<br><ruby>因为他 生病 了，所以没 去 上课。<rt> Yīnwèi tā shēngbìng le, suǒyǐ méi qù shàngkè.</rt></ruby><br>Since he was sick, he didn't go to class.<br><ruby>因为我 很 累，所以要 休息。<rt>Yīnwèi wǒ hěn lèi, suǒyǐ yào xiūxi.</rt></ruby><br>I'm very tired, so I want to rest.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGTDUJO		{}
快 + Verb / Adj. + 了<br>快下雨了。		- Expressing 'about to happen' with 'le'<br>- Remember that 了 (le) is not only for the past! When something isabout to happen,you can also indicate this using 了 (le).  Normally it is paired with a 快 (kuài), 快要(kuàiyào) or a 要 (yào). This is a special form ofusing 了 to indicate a change of situation.<br>- When using 快 ⋯⋯了 (kuài... le) withverbs, it takes on a meaning similar to the English 'just about to.' Normally you can add 要 (yào) before the verb.<br>- 快+ Verb + 了<br>- 快要 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>我们快到了。<rt>Wǒmen kuài dào le.</rt></ruby><br>We're almost there.<br><ruby>快下雨了。<rt>Kuài xiàyǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>It's going to rain soon.<br><ruby>快 要过年了，你 什么 时候 回家？<rt>Kuài yào guònián le, nǐ shénme shíhou huíjiā? </rt></ruby><br>It's almost Chinese New Year. When are you going back to your hometown?<br><hr><br>- Notice that for some translations, it's more natural to use the English word 'almost' instead of 'soon.'<br>- In this structure, 快⋯⋯了 (kuài... le) is closer to the meaning of 'almost' in English.<br>- 快 + Adj. + 了<br><ruby>天快黑了。<rt>Tiān kuài hēi le.</rt></ruby><br>It’s almost getting dark.<br><ruby>我快好了。<rt>Wǒ kuài hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>I'm almost ready.<br><ruby>饭快凉了。<rt>Fàn kuài liáng le.</rt></ruby><br>The food is about to be cold.<br><hr><br>- You can also just use 要 (yào) before the verb, without 快 (kuài).<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb / Adj. + 了<br>- Note that occasionally you'll seeadjectives(instead of verbs) in this pattern as well.<br><ruby>我要生气了！<rt>Wǒ yào shēngqì le!</rt></ruby><br>I'm going to get angry! <br><ruby>他们 的 孩子要出生了。<rt>Tāmen de háizi yào chūshēng le.</rt></ruby><br>Their child is about to be born.<br><ruby>9 点 了，超市要关门了。<rt>Jiǔ diǎn le, chāoshì yào guānmén le.</rt></ruby><br>It's 9 o'clock.

什么 + 都 / 也⋯⋯<br>爸爸什么 都知道。		- Expressing 'everything' with 'shenme dou'<br>- 什么……都 (shénme... dōu) is a pattern often used to express 'all' or 'everything.' Because it's not just one word, though, it can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first.<br>- In this structure, 都 (dōu) is more frequently used than 也 (yě)。<br>- Topic (+ Subj.) + 什么 + 都 / 也 + Verb / Adj.<br>- In some sentences, there will be a subject after the topic in the pattern above. See the following sentences for examples.<br>- When used in the positive sense, it is more natural to follow 什么 (shénme) with 都 (dōu) rather than 也 (yě) to express 'everything.'<br><ruby>我 觉得 这里 的 菜什么都好吃。<rt>Wǒ juéde zhèlǐ de cài shénme dōu hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>I think everything is delicious here.<br><ruby>中国 的 历史 爸爸什么都知道。<rt>Zhōngguó de lìshǐ bàba shénme dōu zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>My dad knows everything about Chinese history.<br><ruby>工作 的 事情 老公什么都跟 我 说。<rt>Gōngzuò de shìqing lǎogōng shénme dōu gēn wǒ shuō.</rt></ruby><br>My husband tells me everything about work stuff.<br><hr><br>- 什么 + Noun + 都 + Verb<br><ruby>我们什么果汁都喝。<rt>Wǒmen shénme guǒzhī dōu hē.</rt></ruby><br>We drink any kind of fruit juice.<br><ruby>她什么衣服都是 黑色 的。<rt>Tā shénme yīfu dōu shì hēisè de.</rt></ruby><br>All of her clothes are black.<br><ruby>妈妈 做 的什么菜都好吃。<rt>Māma zuò de shénme cài dōu hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>All of the dishes mom makes are tasty.<br><hr><br>- The negative structure simply adds a 不 (bù) or a 没 (méi) after the 都 (dōu) / 也 (yě).  Instead of 'all' or 'everything,' this expresses 'none' or 'not any.'<br>- 什么 + Noun + 都 / 也 + 不 + Verb<br>- 什么 + Noun + 都 / 也 + 没 (有) + Verb<br><ruby>生病 以后，爸爸什么酒都不能 喝 了。<rt>Shēngbìng yǐhòu, bàba shénme jiǔ dōu bù néng hē le.</rt></ruby><br>After dad got sick, he can't drink any kind of alcohol.<br><ruby>老板 现在 很 生气，什么人也不见。<rt>Lǎobǎn xiànzài hěn shēngqì, shénme rén  yě bù jiàn.</rt></ruby><br> The boss is very angry.

在 + Place + 上 / 下 / 里 / 旁边<br>你 的 手机在桌子上。		- Expressing location with 'zai... shang / xia / li'<br>- You canuse 在 (zài) to express location, but this article will explain how to use 在 (zài) to express location in relation to another object. This way, you can describe if something is 'on the table' or 'in the room.'<br>- If you're talking about a 'big place,' like a country or city, then all you need is 在 (zài) and the name of the place.<br>- 在 + Place<br>- For example, these phrases are fine just as they are:<br><ruby>在中国<rt>zàiZhōngguó</rt></ruby><br>in China<br><ruby>在美国<rt>zài Měiguó</rt></ruby><br>in the USA<br><ruby>在上海<rt>zài Shànghǎi</rt></ruby><br>in Shanghai<br><hr><br>- You wouldn't want to add other words to the ends of these place names.<br>- To show where an object is in relation to another object, make a 'sandwich' starting with 在 (zài), add a place, and then add one of the following words: 上 (shàng), 下 (xià), 里 (lǐ), 旁边 (pángbiān).<br>- 在 + Location+ 上 / 下 / 里 / 旁边<br>- Notice that the'preposition'comes after the location and object that it modifies. That is, in English we say 'on the table,' but in Chinese, it is more like 'at the table, on.' This can be somewhat confusing, but don't worry. Once you start using this construction, it gets easy really quickly.<br><ruby>在桌子上。<rt>zài zhuōzi shàng</rt></ruby><br>on the table<br><ruby>在地上。<rt>zài dìshàng</rt></ruby><br>on the floor.<br><ruby>你 的 手机在包里吗 ？<rt>Nǐ de shǒujī zài bāo lǐ ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is your cell phone in the bag?<br><hr><br>- 在 + Occasion + 上<br><ruby>在课上<rt>zài kè shàng</rt></ruby><br>in class<br><ruby>在派对上<rt>zài pàiduì shàng</rt></ruby><br>at the party<br><ruby>在会议上<rt>zài huìyì shàng</rt></ruby><br>at the meeting<br><hr><br>- The little words that come after the location in the phrases above aren't really 'prepositions.' They are called 'nouns of locality,' or 方位词 (fāngwèicí) in Chinese.  They actually tend to have several forms, which can be confusing if you're not used to them.  The chart below shows their most common forms:<br>- Some prepositions can be paired with more abstract concepts to form idiomatic phrases. These kinds of phrases can really make your Chinese sound polished. Later on you will learn about theseidiomatic phrases with 'zai'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGFBWZL		{}
别 + Verb + 了<br>别哭了，烦 死了 。		"- Expressing 'stop doing' with 'bie… le'<br>- You may know how to makenegative commands with 'bie,'but what if someone is already doing it? The pattern 别⋯⋯了 (bié... le) is all you need to tell someone toSTOP DOING THAT(which they're already doing).<br>- 别 + Verb / [Verb Phrase] + 了<br>- Instead of just averb, it can also be a verb phrase.<br><ruby>别说了， 我 不 想 听 。<rt>Bié shuō le, wǒ bù xiǎng tīng.</rt></ruby><br>Stop talking. I don't want to listen.<br><ruby>别问了， 我 不 想 说 。<rt>Bié wèn le, wǒ bù xiǎng shuō.</rt></ruby><br>Stop asking. I don't want to say.<br><ruby>别做了，明天 做 吧 。<rt>Bié zuò le, míngtiān zuò ba.</rt></ruby><br>Stop doing it. Do it tomorrow.<br><hr><br>- The '别 verb 了“ pattern can also be used to negate the other person's suggestion or try to change their idea. The difference between this usage and the previous example is that the action has not happened yet.

不 vs 没<br>我 今天 晚上不吃饭。昨天 晚上 我没吃饭。		- Comparing 'bu' and 'mei'<br>- Both不 (bù)and没 (méi)can be placed in front of a verb or adjective to negate its meaning.  However, 不 (bù) and 没 (méi) are not usually interchangeable, so it's important to learn when you must use 不 (bù) as opposed to 没 (méi), and vice versa.<br>- 不 (bù) is generally used to negate an action that youdo not want to doordo not intend to do(in the future).  So expressing things like 'I don't want to go' or 'I'm not going' would be uses of 不 (bù).<br>- Subj. + 不 + Verb<br>- Whether it's 'don't wanna do it'  or 'not gonna do it,' use 不 (bù):<br><ruby>我 今天 晚上不喝酒。<rt>Wǒ jīntiān wǎnshang bù hējiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>Tonight I'm not going to drink.<br><ruby>爸爸不回来 吃 晚饭。<rt>Bàba bù huílái chī wǎnfàn.</rt></ruby><br>Dad is not coming back to eat dinner.<br><ruby>老板 明天不来 。<rt>Lǎobǎn míngtiān bù lái.</rt></ruby><br>The boss won't come tomorrow.<br><hr><br>- 不 (bù) can be used to negate habitual actions, to express what you just aren't in the habit of doing, such as eating meat, or watching TV, or drinking alcohol.  This is simply done by placing 不 (bù) in front of the verb.<br>- Subj. + 不 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>我不吃 肉。<rt>Wǒ bù chī ròu.</rt></ruby><br>I don't eat meat.<br><ruby>你们 都不喝酒 吗？<rt>Nǐmen dōu bù hējiǔ ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you all not drink alcohol?<br><ruby>他不喜欢 说话。<rt>Tā bù xǐhuan shuōhuà.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't like to speak.<br><hr><br>- Please note that, while it is grammatically correct to use 没 (méi) in all the sentences above, 没 (méi) does not negate anyhabitualactions. The sentences above, if they contained 没 (méi) instead of 不 (bù), would express that the speakerdidn't dothe named activity (at one particular pointin the past).  So it would not be abouthabitual actions.<br>- When it comes to a simple negation of an adjective (such as 'not cold'), use 不 (bù).<br>- 不 + Adj.<br><ruby>我们不饿。<rt>Wǒmen bù è.</rt></ruby><br>We're not hungry.<br><ruby>你不胖。<rt>Nǐ bù pàng.</rt></ruby><br>You are not fat.<br><ruby>我 家不远。<rt>Wǒ jiā bù yuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>My home is not far.<br><hr><br>- There are couple ways to use 不 (bù) to ask questions. One such way is throughaffirmative-negative questions. This is done by stating a verb and then immediately repeating that verb in a negative state (with 不 (bù)).<br>- Subj. + Verb + 不 + Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>你 是 不是我 的 老师？<rt>Nǐ shì bu shì wǒ de lǎoshī? </rt></ruby><br>Are you my teacher or not? <br><ruby>她 想不想 来？<rt>Tā xiǎng bu xiǎnglái? </rt></ruby><br>Does she want to come?<br><ruby>你 爱不爱 我？<rt>Nǐ ài bu ài wǒ? </rt></ruby><br>Do you love me or not? <br><hr><br>- 不 (bù) can also be used to formtag questions.  Tag questions use the positive-negative question form, but are placed at the end of the sentence. Tag questions are used to seek approval or acceptance for a statement, very similar to the English 'OK?' or 'right?'  You can't use 没 (méi) for this.<br><hr><br>- 没 (méi) and 没有 (méiyǒu) can both be used tonegate actions that occurred in the past, or to say that something has not happened yet.<br>- Subj. + 没(有) + Verb + Obj.<br><hr><br>- There are a few things worth noting in these examples. For one, it is still grammatically correct to leave out the 有 (yǒu) in the sentences using 没有 (méiyǒu).  Also, the sentences using 不 (bù)would begrammatically correct, if not for the time words telling us that it is definitely thepastwe're talking about.<br>- 没 (méi) can be used to negate the verb 有 (yǒu)('to have') to mean 'do not have.' You can only use 没 (méi) to convey this meaning. It is grammatically incorrect to use 不 (bù) to negate 有 (yǒu).<br>- Subj. + 没有 + Obj.<br><hr><br>- There are times when you can leave out 有 (yǒu) entirely while still expressing 没有 (méiyǒu), (meaning 'to not have' or 'there is no'). One well-known example of this is没办法 (méi bànfǎ)('there is no way' [that's gonna happen]).  Both 没 (méi) and 没有 (méiyǒu) are correct, however.<br><ruby>我没办法。<rt>Wǒ méi bànfǎ.</rt></ruby><br>I don't have a way.<br><ruby>我没有办法。<rt>Wǒ méiyǒu bànfǎ.</rt></ruby><br>I don't have a way.<br><hr><br>- (You can alsouse 没办法 (méi bànfǎ)to express other meanings.)<br>- 没 (méi) or 没有 (méiyǒu) can be used to makesimple comparisonsmeaning 'not as... as...':<br>- Noun 1 + 没有 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br><hr><br>- You can only use 没 (méi) or 没有 (méiyǒu) for this purpose, andnot不 (bù).<br>- Certain verbs just don't get negated by 没 (méi) or 没有 (méiyǒu) ever.  These include the verbs 是 (shì) ('to be') and 在 (zài) ('to be (in a place)'), as well as some psychological verbs such as 知道 (zhīdào) ('to know') and 认识 (rènshi) ('to know (a person)').  For these verbs, it's best to just take them on a case-by-case basis.  Being aware of their existence can save you a fair bit of confusion.<br>- Note that in non-standard Mandarin you might encounter exceptions to this rule.  It's still useful to know the rule!<br>- If you're pretty clear on the explanations you've read so far and the examples make sense to you, you still need to put your knowledge to the test.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGRJ1BI		{}
要 vs 想<br>我要一 杯 水 。 我想你 。		- Comparing 'yao' and 'xiang'<br>- Both 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) can essentially mean 'want,' but they can also be used in quite different ways, such as 想 (xiǎng) also meaning 'to miss' when followed by a noun, and 要 (yào) also meaning 'going to (do something).'<br>- Both 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) may be followed by nouns, but pay attention to how the meaning of 想 (xiǎng) totally changes when used this way.<br>- In this pattern, 要 (yào) is directly followed by a thing (a noun), rather than by a verb. It is often used to buy something, or to order food at a restaurant.<br>- It may be helpful to imagine a demanding child using this pattern to get stuff from his parents. This 'I want x!' pattern can seem slightly impolite, but to the Chinese ear it's not as inherently rude as it may seem when translated directly into English. Tone of voice plays a key role when using this pattern in spoken Chinese.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Noun<br>- Pay attention here:unlike '想 (xiǎng) + Verb,' the meaning of 想 (xiǎng) in the '想 (xiǎng) + Noun' pattern becomes 'to miss.'<br>- Subj. + 想 + Noun<br><ruby>我想你。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I miss you.<br><ruby>我 有点想我 的 家人。<rt>Wǒ yǒudiǎn  xiǎng wǒ de jiārén.</rt></ruby><br>I sort of miss my family.<br><ruby>你们 回 美国 以后， 会想中国菜 吗？<rt>Nǐmen huí Měiguó yǐhòu, huì  xiǎng Zhōngguó cài ma? </rt></ruby><br>Will you all miss Chinese food after you go back to the U.S.? <br><hr><br>- 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) have similar meanings when followed by verbs. The difference is rather subtle, but 要 (yào) can sound more urgent or demanding (sometimes even childish), while 想 (xiǎng) is usually a bit more mature and polite. Tone of voice plays a big role here as well, though, so don't be afraid of offending people by using 要 (yào); the word itself isn't rude.<br>- It might help to think of 要 (yào) in this sense as meaning 'want to' and 想 (xiǎng) as meaning 'would like to.'<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb<br><ruby>我要休息 。<rt>Wǒ yào xiūxi.</rt></ruby><br>I want to rest.<br><ruby>你 也要回家 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ yě yào huíjiā ma? </rt></ruby><br>Do you also want to go home? <br><ruby>你们要喝 什么 ？<rt>Nǐmen yào hē shénme? </rt></ruby><br>What do you want to drink? <br><hr><br>- It might help to think of 想 (xiǎng) as meaning 'would like to' instead of 'want to.' In English, as well, 'would like to' feels more indirect, and thus less demanding and more more polite.<br>- Subj. + 想 + Verb<br><ruby>你想去 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ xiǎng qù ma? </rt></ruby><br>Would you like to go? <br><ruby>我 不想见 她 。<rt>Wǒ bù xiǎng jiàn tā.</rt></ruby><br>I wouldn't like to see her.<br><ruby>周末 你们想看 电影 吗 ？<rt>Zhōumò nǐmen xiǎng kàn diànyǐng ma? </rt></ruby><br>Would you like to see a movie this weekend? <br><hr><br>- 要 is used to indicate plans for the near future, much like 'going to' in English. 想 (xiǎng) is not used in this way.<br>- Subj. + 要 + Verb<br><ruby>星期六 我要去 北京。<rt>Xīngqīliù wǒ yào qù Běijīng.</rt></ruby><br>I'm going to Beijing on Saturday.<br><ruby>下 个 月 她要找 新 工作。<rt>Xià gè yuè tā yào zhǎo xīn gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>She is going to look for a new job next month.<br><ruby>这个 周末 你们要出去 玩 吗？<rt>Zhège zhōumò nǐmen yào  chūqù wán ma? </rt></ruby><br>Are you going out partying this weekend? <br><hr><br>- You can put 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) together to make the word 想要 (xiǎngyào), which means 'to want.' You can put either nouns or verbs after it.<br>- Subj. + 想要 + Noun / Verb<br><ruby>你想要几 个 孩子 ？<rt>Nǐ xiǎngyào jǐ gè háizi? </rt></ruby><br>How many kids do you want to have? <br><ruby>我 老婆 总是想要最 贵 的 包。<rt>Wǒ lǎopo zǒngshì xiǎngyào zuì guì de bāo.</rt></ruby><br>My wife always wants the most expensive bags.<br><ruby>她想要找 一 个 有钱 的 男朋友 。<rt>Tā xiǎngyào zhǎo yī gè yǒuqián de nánpéngyou.</rt></ruby><br>She wants to find a rich boyfriend.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD88UO		{}
Adj. + 极了<br>这个 主意 好极了。		- Adjectives with '-ji le'<br>- Just as死了 (sǐle) can be used to intensify negative adjectives, 极了 (jíle) is a somewhat less common way to intensify both positive and negative adjectives. It is used in spoken, colloquial Chinese. 极 (jí) means 'extreme' or 'utmost.'<br>- This structure is technically a kind ofdegree complementand one of the few that you can use after the adjective and without adding a 得 (de). Remember to add the 了 (le), since it would be incorrect without it.<br>- Subj. + Adj. + 极了<br>- Some examples with a positive connotation:<br><ruby>这个 主意 好极了。<rt>Zhège zhǔyi hǎo jíle.</rt></ruby><br>This idea is perfect.<br><ruby>味道 好极了!<rt>Wèidào hǎo jíle!</rt></ruby><br>The taste is perfect!<br><ruby>他 的 英文 棒极了。<rt>Tā de Yīngwén bàng jíle.</rt></ruby><br>His English is perfect.<br><hr><br>- Some examples with a negative connotation:<br><ruby>昨天 的 派对 无聊极了!<rt>Zuótiān de pàiduì wúliáo jíle!</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday's party was so boring!<br><ruby>他 那么 生气 ，我们 都 害怕极了。<rt>Tā nàme shēngqì, wǒmen dōu hàipà jíle.</rt></ruby><br>He was so angry.

不怎么 + Adj.<br>这里 的 菜 他不怎么 好吃！		- Expressing 'not very' with 'bu zenme'<br>- When you use 不怎么 (bù zěnme) before an adjective, it means 'not very.' You might use it to say something like 'not very good.'<br>- When used together with an adjective, 不怎么 becomes similar to不太, which means that the degree of the adjective is not very high.<br>- Subj. + 不怎么 + Adj. / [Psychological Verb]<br>- Using this grammar structure is a way to indirectly or mildly state something. Instead of saying 他不聪明 (tā bù cōngming) you can say 他不怎么聪明 (tā bù zěnme cōngming), turning a very direct statement to a milder, more inoffensive comment.<br><ruby>最近不 怎么忙 。<rt>Zuìjìn bù zěnme máng.</rt></ruby><br>It hasn't been very busy lately.<br><ruby>这里 的 冬天不 怎么冷 。<rt>Zhèlǐ de dōngtiān bù zěnme lěng.</rt></ruby><br>It's not very cold here in winter.<br><ruby>他们 好像不 怎么高兴 。<rt>Tāmen hǎoxiàng bù zěnme gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>They don't seem to be very happy.<br><hr><br>- Remember that to make 不怎么 mean 'not very' you need to use it with anadjective. Using it with a verb will give itthe meaning of 'not often.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVYIZT		{}
全 + Noun<br>我们全家 都 去 旅游 了。		- Indicating the whole with 'quan'<br>- One of the uses of 全 (quán) is to indicate the entirety of something. It could be used for something like awholehousehold, anentirecountry, thewholeworld, etc.<br>- Simply put 全 in front of the noun you want to emphasize 'the whole' of. You cannot use it with 的. Pay attention to the types of nouns you can use with 全, since it is usually paired up with 身 (body), 家 (family), 国 (country), 世界 (world), 天 (day) and the like.<br>- 全 + Noun + 都 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>我们全家都去 过 北京 。<rt>Wǒmen quán jiā dōu qù guo Běijīng.</rt></ruby><br>Our entire family has been to Beijing.<br><ruby>全公司 的 人都不 喜欢 新 老板 。<rt>Quán gōngsī de rén dōu bù xǐhuan xīn lǎobǎn.</rt></ruby><br>The whole company doesn't like the new boss.<br><ruby>运动 完 以后 我全身都是 汗 。<rt>Yùndòng wán yǐhòu wǒ quán shēn dōu shì hàn.</rt></ruby><br>My whole body was sweaty after I finished exercising.<br><hr><br>- Before a verb 全 can be omitted, but if it is used, the purpose is to emphasize the idea of 'all' or 'entire.'<br>- Subj. + 全都 + Predicate<br><ruby>大家全都到 了。<rt>Dàjiā quán dōu dào le.</rt></ruby><br>Everybody has arrived.<br><ruby>奶奶 的 头发全都白 了。<rt>Nǎinai de tóufà quán dōu bái le.</rt></ruby><br>All of grandma's hair has turned white.<br><ruby>我 妈妈 做 的 菜全都好吃 。<rt>Wǒ māma zuò de cài quán dōu hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>All of the food that my mother makes is tasty.<br><hr><br>- When you negate 全都 with 不 or 没afterit, you're not just saying 'not entirely,' you're saying 'none of it' or 'not at all.'<br>- Subj. + 全都 + 不 / 没 + Predicate<br><ruby>他们全都没 去 。<rt>Tāmen quán dōu méi qù.</rt></ruby><br>None of them went.<br><ruby>这个 周末 我们全都不 在 家 。<rt>Zhège zhōumò wǒmen quán dōu bú zài jiā.</rt></ruby><br>None of us will be home this weekend.<br><ruby>你们全都不 怕 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen quán dōu bú pà ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are none of you afraid?<br><hr><br>- When you negate by putting 不 or 没before全都, you're onlypartiallynegating.

Adj. + Adj.<br>你 应该慢慢地 走。		- Reduplication of adjectives<br>- One of the charming features of Chinese is reduplication (repeating, or doubling up) of certain words and characters, includingadjectives. Reduplication can enhance the descriptive feeling of an adjective.<br>- If an adjective is only one syllable (one character), then reduplicating it is a no-brainer. The only tricky part about this pattern is that not all adjectives can be reduplicated in natural speech. It's mostly for adjectives that describe the physical world: colors, sizes, shapes, and other physical descriptors.<br>- Adj. + Adj. + 的 (+ Noun)<br>- In most Chinese textbooks and grammar books, this is known as the 'AA' pattern. We'll be using this form more extensively below:<br>- A A + 的 (+ Noun)<br>- Note that this pattern is also identical tosingle-syllable reduplication of verbs.<br><ruby>你 的 脸红 红 的。<rt>Nǐ de liǎn hóng hóng de.</rt></ruby><br>Your face is red.<br><ruby>宝宝 的 眼睛大 大 的。<rt>Bǎobao de yǎnjīng dà dà de.</rt></ruby><br>The baby's eyes are big.<br><ruby>今晚 的 月亮圆 圆 的。<rt>Jīnwǎn de yuèliàng yuán yuán de.</rt></ruby><br>The moon is round tonight.<br><hr><br>- If the adjective has more than one character, then you should repeat each character individually (rather than the whole word).  This is known as the 'AABB' pattern.<br>- In the structure below, the original two-character adjective (such as 高兴, 漂亮) is 'AB,' where the first character of the adjective is represented by 'A,' and the second by 'B.'<br>- A  A  B  B  + 的 (+ Noun)<br>- Not all two-syllable adjectives are used in AABB form, but here are some common examples of AB adjectives represented in AABB form.<br><ruby>高兴 → 高高兴兴<rt>gāoxìng ￫ gāogāo-xìngxìng</rt></ruby><br>happy<br><ruby>热闹 → 热热闹闹<rt>rènao ￫ rèrè-nāonāo</rt></ruby><br>noisy, boisterous<br><ruby>漂亮 → 漂漂亮亮<rt>piàoliang ￫ piàopiào-liāngliāng</rt></ruby><br>pretty<br><hr><br>- Not all adjectives can take AABB form.  Here are some examples of common adjectives that don't work in AABB form.<br><hr><br>- When adjectives are used asadverbsto modify verbs, you can reduplicate the adjective using the AABB pattern.<br>- AABB + 地 + Verb<br>- Note:The 'AABB' pattern for reduplication of two-syllable adjectives contrasts with the'ABAB' pattern for reduplication of two-syllable verbs.<br><ruby>我们清清楚楚地看到 他 跟 一 个 胖 胖 的 男人 上 车 了 。<rt>Wǒmen qīngqīng-chǔchǔ de kàndào tā gēn yī gè pàng pàng de nánrén shàngchē le.</rt></ruby><br>We clearly saw him get in the car with a fat man.<br><ruby>我 真 想舒舒服服地躺 在 沙发 上 看 电视 。<rt>Wǒ zhēn xiǎng shūshū-fūfū de tǎng zài shāfā shàng kàn diànshì.</rt></ruby><br>I'd really like to comfortably lie on the couch and watch TV.<br><ruby>你 妈妈辛辛苦苦地做 了 两 个 小时 的 饭，你 怎么 不 吃 ？<rt>Nǐ māma xīnxīn-kǔkǔ de zuò le liǎng gè xiǎoshí de fàn, nǐ zěnme bù chī?</rt></ruby><br>Your mother labored over this meal for two hours, and you aren't going to eat it?<br><hr><br>- If you use anadjectiveas apredicate, then you're basically using the adjective like a verb, and you reduplicate itas you would a verb, which means ABAB form.  Using an adjective in this way is roughly equivalent to using 一下 after the (non-reduplicated) adjective.<br>- To use a reduplicated adjective as a predicate, follow this structure:<br>- Subj. + ABAB<br>- or<br>- Subj. + AB + 一下<br>- In the pattern above there's no verb because when an adjective serves as the predicate, it does the job of a verb.  Notice also that there's no 的 after the ABAB, because 的 is used when modifying nouns.<br><ruby>妹妹 快 过 生日 了 ，我 打算 给 她 办 一 个 生日 派对 ，热闹 热闹。<rt>Mèimei kuài guò shēngrì le, wǒ dǎsuàn gěi tā bàn yī gè shēngrì pàiduì, rènao rènao.</rt></ruby><br>My little sister's birthday is coming and I plan to throw her a birthday party and have a blast.<br><ruby>来 ，喝 点 酒 ，高兴 高兴。<rt>Lái, hē diǎn jiǔ, gāoxìng gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>Come on, have a little wine and enjoy yourself.<br><ruby>到 这里 来凉快 凉快。<rt>Dào zhèlǐ lái liángkuai liángkuai.</rt></ruby><br>Come over here and cool off.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGDHE8S		{}
Adj. + 地 + Verb<br>你 要 认真地学习。		- Turning adjectives into adverbs<br>- You can easily convert most Chineseadjectivesinto adverbs with the particle地(de). This usage is very similar to thesuffix-lyin English.<br>- In Chinese, we place the structural particle 地 (de) after the adjective to make it function as an adverb.<br>- Subj. + Adj. + 地 + Verb<br><ruby>你 要努力地学习 。<rt>Nǐ yào nǔlì de xuéxí.</rt></ruby><br>You must study hard.<br><ruby>雨天 地 滑 ，慢 慢地走 。<rt>Yǔtiān dì huá, màn màn de zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>The floor is very slippery on rainy days.

Subj. + 正好 + Verb Phrase<br>他正好问 了 我 想 问 的 问题 。		- Coincidence with 'zhenghao'<br>- 正好 (zhènghǎo) can be used as an adjective or adverb to help express a coincidence, and it could be related to time, size, volume, quantity, degree, etc. In English we might say something similar like, “oh, this shirt you gave me just happens to be in my favorite color.'<br>- You can also use 正好 to mean 'happen to be.'<br>- Subj. + 正好 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>我正好要 出去 ，垃圾 我 来 扔 吧 。<rt>Wǒ zhènghǎo yào chūqù, lājī wǒ lái rēng ba.</rt></ruby><br>I'm just about to leave.

Subj. + 还 + Verb Phrase / Adj.<br>你还在看 书 ？		- Continuation with 'hai'<br>- Although还(hái) has many meanings, the basic meaning of 'still' to indicate a continuing action is essential to mastery of the word.<br>- Often theauxiliary verb在(zài) will appear with 还 (hái), as it is natural to talk aboutcontinuousactions that arestillhappening.<br>- Subj. + 还在 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>这 件 事情 我还 在考虑 。<rt>Zhè jiàn shìqing wǒ hái zài kǎolǜ.</rt></ruby><br>I am still thinking over this matter.<br><ruby>已经 中午 了 ，他还 在睡 ？<rt>Yǐjīng zhōngwǔ le, tā hái zài shuì? </rt></ruby><br>It's already noon and he's still sleeping?<br><ruby>她还 在生气 吗 ？<rt>Tā hái zài shēngqì ma? </rt></ruby><br>Is she still mad?<br><hr><br>- Here 还是 (háishì)--not literally 'still is'--indicates what happened or will happen,despitethe situation. The是(shì) here doesn't have a clear meaning here independent of 还 (hái).<br>- ⋯⋯ ，(但是 / 可是 +) Subj. + 还是 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>我 让 他 不要 买 ，他还是买 了 。<rt>Wǒ ràng tā bùyào mǎi, tā háishì mǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>I told him not to buy it, but he still bought it.<br><ruby>他 不 想 离婚 ，但是 最后还是离婚 了 。<rt>Tā bù xiǎng líhūn, dànshì zuìhòu háishì líhūn le.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't want to get divorced, but in the end he still ended up getting divorced.<br><ruby>父母 不 同意 他 去 ，可是 他还是去 了。<rt>Fùmǔ bù tóngyì tā qù, kěshì tā háishì qù le.</rt></ruby><br>His parents didn't agree to it, but he still went.<br><hr><br>- When you put不or没after 还 (hái) in a question sentence, it can be used to emphasize the idea of whatshouldbe happening in a more idiomatic way.<br>- Subj. + 还 + 不 / 没 + [Verb Phrase]	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIRILI		{}
就是 + Verb<br>我 父母就是不 让 我 一个人 去 。		- Emphasis with 'jiushi'<br>- As an adverb, 就 (jiù) can be placed before thepredicateto add emphasis. It often has an intense or provocative feel to it, similar to 'just.' In English we might say, 'it'sjustnot right!' This emphasis very often appears as 就是 in Chinese.<br>- 就是 + Noun<br><ruby>那个 人就是她 的 新 男朋友。<rt>Nàge rén jiùshì tā de xīn nánpéngyou.</rt></ruby><br>That guy is her new boyfriend.<br><ruby>他就是你 要 找 的 人 。<rt>Tā jiùshì nǐ yào zhǎo de rén.</rt></ruby><br>He's just the person that you're looking for.<br><ruby>我们就是他 的 家人 。<rt>Wǒmen jiùshì tā de jiārén.</rt></ruby><br>We're his family.<br><hr><br>- 就是 can be used to intensify the predicate to mean 'only (because of) that and nothing else.' In this case, 是 can't be omitted. In many cases, you could also add in an 因为, but it's not required.<br><ruby>他 不 去 旅游就是不 想 花钱 。<rt>Tā bù qù lǚyóu jiùshì bù xiǎng huāqián.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't travel only because he doesn't want to spend the money.<br><ruby>你 不 参加 比赛就是怕 输 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ bù cānjiā bǐsài jiùshì pà shū ma?</rt></ruby><br>You're not entering the competition just because you're afraid of losing?<br><ruby>他 这样 说就是不 喜欢 我 。<rt>Tā zhèyàng shuō jiùshì bù xǐhuan wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>He said this only because he doesn't like me.<br><hr><br>- In the examples above, 就 pairs exclusively with the verb 是. But 就 can also come before other verbs, with similar emphatic effect. In these cases, it's also OK to use 就是 before the other verbs as well.<br>- 就(是) + (不) + Verb<br><ruby>我就要 去！<rt>Wǒ jiù yào qù! </rt></ruby><br>I just want to go! <br><ruby>我就是喜欢 他。<rt>Wǒ jiù shì  xǐhuan tā.</rt></ruby><br>I just like him.<br><ruby>我就不 告诉 你 。<rt>Wǒ jiù bù gàosu nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I'm just not going to tell you.<br><hr><br>- As you may have noticed, many of these uses of 就 or 就是 carry a flippant, stubborn tone, referred to as 任性 (rènxìng) in Chinese.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGY21RK		{}
又 + 不 / 没 + Verb<br>又没 下雨 ，带 伞 干吗 ？		- Emphasizing negation with 'you'<br>- You already know that不(bù) and没(méi) can be used for negation. But you can also use the word 又 (yòu) to emphasize negation, giving your negative sentence a little kick!<br>- In this structure, 又 is used to emphasize that something 'didn'thappen,' 'is not' the case, or 'will nothappen.' It's most often used with不and没. This grammar structure is often used in an accusatory context, and when used with other expressions like 干吗 (gànmá) can show annoyance.<br>- 又 + 不 / 没 + Predicate<br><ruby>问 我 干吗 ？我又不知道 。<rt>Wèn wǒ gànmá? Wǒ yòu bù zhīdào. </rt></ruby><br>Why ask me? I definitely don't know.<br><ruby>这些 菜又没坏 ，为什么 要 扔 ？<rt>Zhèxiē cài yòu méi huài, wèishénme yào rēng?</rt></ruby><br>These dishes haven't gone bad.

还有 + Time Period + 就要 + Verb Phrase + 了<br>还有五 天就要放假了。		- Expressing 'about to' with 'jiuyao'<br>- 就要 (jiùyào) is similar to 快要 (kuàiyào), meaning 'about to.' They are interchangeable in some cases. But there is a major difference that you need to take a good look at.<br>- (Subj. +) 就要 + Verb + 了 (，⋯⋯)<br><ruby>就 要下雨了。<rt>Jiù yào xiàyǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>It's about to rain.<br><ruby>他们就 要结婚了。<rt>Tāmen jiù yào jiéhūn le.</rt></ruby><br>They are about to get married.<br><ruby>我就 要出国了。<rt>Wǒ jiù yào chūguó le.</rt></ruby><br>I'm about to go abroad.<br><hr><br>- In this case, 就要 can bereplaced by 快要 or 快.<br>- 快要 (kuài yào) is generally 'about to' [happen], but 就要 (jiù yào) could be used to mark a more specific time. 要 (yào) here can be omitted. For this one, you wouldn't normally use 'about to' for this English translation, but the feeling is nevertheless that the impending event is coming up fast. This use of 就 (jiù) overlaps with itsusage indicating earliness.<br>- 还有 + Time (+ Subj.) + 就 (要) + Verb + 了<br><ruby>还有十 分钟 我就下班了。<rt>Háiyǒu shí fēnzhōng wǒ jiù xiàbān le.</rt></ruby><br>I get off work in 10 minutes.<br><ruby>还有两 个 星期 我们就 要考试了。<rt>Háiyǒu liǎng gè xīngqí wǒmen jiù yào kǎoshì le.</rt></ruby><br>We're just two weeks away from the exam date.<br><ruby>还有一 个 月就 要过年了。<rt>Háiyǒu yī gè yuè jiù yào guònián le.</rt></ruby><br>It will be Chinese New Year in another month.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9B210		{}
再 + Verb<br>我 下 次再来。		- Expressing 'again' in the future with 'zai'<br>- While 又 (yòu) is used for'again' in the past, 再 (zài) is used for 'again' in the future. That is, 再 is used when something has happened once and itwillhappen again.<br>- Remember this is thefuture'again.'<br>- Subj. + 再 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>我们 明年再来 。<rt>Wǒmen míngnián zài lái.</rt></ruby><br>We'll come again next year.<br><ruby>再试 一下 。<rt>Zài shì yīxià.</rt></ruby><br>Try it again.<br><ruby>你 可以再说 一 遍 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ kěyǐ zài shuō yī biàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you please say it again?<br><hr><br>- In fact, this structure is present in one of the most common Chinese phrases: '再见!' In this case, it literally means 'see you again.'<br>- The English word 'another' is often avoided altogether by using 再.<br>- Subj. + 再 + Verb + Obj.<br>- In this case, the object includes a quantity phrase.<br><ruby>再吃一点。<rt>Zài chī yīdiǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Eat some more.<br><ruby>再点几个 菜吧 。<rt>Zài diǎn jǐ gè cài ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's order some more dishes.<br><ruby>服务员 ，再来两 瓶 啤酒。<rt>Fúwùyuán, zài lái liǎng píng píjiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>Waiter, two more bottles of beer, please.<br><hr><br>- Here 再 is similar to the English 'for a while longer' or 'keep [going/doing].'<br>- Subj. + 再 + Verb + Verb<br><ruby>再找找 。<rt>Zài zhǎozhao.</rt></ruby><br>Keep looking.<br><ruby>你再问问 。<rt>Nǐ zài wènwen.</rt></ruby><br>Keep asking.<br><ruby>别 急 ，再想想 。<rt>Bié jí, zài xiǎngxiang.</rt></ruby><br>Don't worry. Keep thinking.<br><hr><br>- You can also add 一会儿 after the verb to mean 'keep doing something a little longer.'<br><ruby>再聊 一会儿 。<rt>Zài liáo yīhuǐr.</rt></ruby><br>Keep talking for a little bit.<br><ruby>再等 一会儿 。<rt>Zài děng yīhuǐr.</rt></ruby><br>Wait a little longer.<br><hr><br>- You can use either the 'Verb + Verb' pattern or the 一会儿 pattern with 再, but don't use them together.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIZQJ2		{}
又 + Verb + 了<br>你又迟到了。		- Expressing 'again' in the past with 'you'<br>- Whenever you want to express something that has happenedagain, as in, 'oops, I did itagain!' in Chinese, you generally want to use 又 (yòu). (You'll want to use再 (zài) for 'again' in the future.)<br>- Normally, 又 is used to express an action that has already happened again for (at least) the second time. It doesn't have to be in quick succession; it happened before, and now it's happened again.<br>- (Subj. +) 又 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>又下雨了！<rt>Yòu xiàyǔ le!</rt></ruby><br>It rained again!<br><ruby>你又迟到了。<rt>Nǐ yòu chídào le.</rt></ruby><br>You're late again.<br><ruby>宝宝又哭了。<rt>Bǎobao yòu kū le.</rt></ruby><br>The baby is crying again.<br><hr><br>- (Subj. +) 又 + 不 / 没 + Verb<br><ruby>他又没来 上课 。<rt>Tā yòu méi lái shàngkè.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't come to class again.<br><ruby>你们又不付钱 ？<rt>Nǐmen yòu bù fùqián?</rt></ruby><br>You're not paying again?<br><ruby>你又不参加 ？<rt>Nǐ yòu bù cānjiā?</rt></ruby><br>You are not going to participate again?<br><hr><br>- 又来了 fits the above pattern, but is also a little tricky because it expresses something that is still ongoing, and has already started as the speaker is speaking. Literally it means 'here it comes again,' but it's more accurate to translate it as 'there it is again,' or 'there [he] goes again.' It indicates that the speaker is a bit annoyed that it happenedagain.<br>- When it becomes clear that something is about to happen again, you can also use 又. It's almost as if it has already happened in your mind. In these cases, it's quite common for 又 to be immediately followed by 是 (shì), 要 (yào), 可以 (kěyǐ), or 能 (néng), and you'll notice that there's often a了, indicating that something is about to happen.<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>今天又要加班了！<rt>Jīntiān yòu yào jiābān le!</rt></ruby><br>We've got to work overtime again today!<br><ruby>老板 请客 ，又可以吃 大餐了！<rt>Lǎobǎn qǐngkè, yòu kěyǐ chī dàcān le!</rt></ruby><br>The boss is going to treat us. We can have a big meal again!<br><ruby>快 过年 了 ，我们又能拿 红包了！<rt>Kuài guònián le, wǒmen yòu néng ná hóngbāo le!</rt></ruby><br>It's almost Chinese New Year. We can get our red packets [of money] again!<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGN1JR5		{}
Subj. + 原来 + Predicate<br>原来昨天 那个 人 是 你 啊 。		- Expressing 'all along' with 'yuanlai'<br>- 原来 (yuánlái) means 'originally' (similar to本来) as anadverb, or 'original' or 'former' as anadjective. As an adverb it can also mean 'all along' and can be used to indicate a sudden realization of something previously unknown—a bit like, 'so it's been like that all along... how could I have not realized?'<br>- When used as an adjective:<br>- 原来 + 的 + Noun<br>- When used as an adverb:<br>- Subj. + 原来 + Predicate<br><ruby>你原来的 发型 也 很 可爱 。<rt>Nǐ yuánlái de fàxíng yě hěn kě'ài.</rt></ruby><br>Your original hairstyle was also very cute.<br><ruby>这 件 衣服原来的 价格 是 999 块 。<rt>Zhè jiàn yīfu yuánlái de jiàgé shì jiǔbǎi jiǔshí-jiǔ kuài.</rt></ruby><br>The original price of this piece of clothing was 999 RMB.<br><ruby>她们原来只是 邻居 ，现在 是 很好 的 朋友 。<rt>Tāmen yuánlái zhǐ shì línjū, xiànzài shì hěn hǎo de péngyou.</rt></ruby><br>Originally they were just neighbors. Now they're very good friends.<br><hr><br>- 原来 + [New Information]<br><ruby>原来是 你 ！<rt>Yuánlái shì nǐ!</rt></ruby><br>So it was you all along!<br><ruby>原来你们 认识 ！<rt>Yuánlái nǐmen rènshi!</rt></ruby><br> So you both knew each other this whole time!<br><ruby>原来是 这样 ！<rt>Yuánlái shì zhèyàng!</rt></ruby><br>Oh, so it's like that!<br><hr><br>- The more formal expression 原来如此 (yuánlái rúcǐ) can be used like 原来是这样 in example 3.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGTKXFR		{}
Subj. + 一下子 + Verb + 了<br>天气一下子变 冷了。		- Expressing 'all at once' with 'yixiazi'<br>- 一下子 (yīxiàzi) can be used as anadverb, meaning 'all at once.' Because it inherently encompasses a sense of 'completion,' it's typically going to be followed by a了(le) later in the sentence.<br>- 一下子 (yīxiàzi) is a very informal expression to describe how fast things happened. It usually touches upon sudden or severe changes in a very short amount of time. Although 一下子 (yīxiàzi) is already quite informal, in colloquial Chinese 一下 (yīxià) can also be used to express the same thing.<br>- Subj. + 一下子 + Predicate + 了<br><ruby>天气一下子变 冷了。<rt>Tiānqì yīxiàzi biàn lěng le.</rt></ruby><br>The weather suddenly got cold.<br><ruby>他一下子吃了三 碗 米饭 。<rt>Tā yīxiàzi chī le sān wǎn mǐfàn.</rt></ruby><br>He ate three bowls of rice all at once.<br><ruby>她 下楼 的时候一下子摔倒了。<rt>Tā xiàlóu de shíhou yīxiàzi shuāidǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>As she went down the stairs, she suddenly fell.<br><hr><br>- 一下子 (yīxiàzi), followed with就(jiù), usually implies that things happened very quickly, naturally, and easily. Again, 一下 (yīxià) can also be used instead of 一下子 (yīxiàzi).<br>- Subj. + 一下子 + 就 + Predicate + 了<br><ruby>老师 进来 以后 ，大家一下子就安静了。<rt>Lǎoshī jìnlái yǐhòu, dàjiā yīxiàzi jiù ānjìng le.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone became silent after the teacher came in.<br><ruby>听 他 说 完 ，我一下子就明白了。<rt>Tīng tā shuō wán, wǒ yīxiàzi jiù míngbai le.</rt></ruby><br>After hearing him out, I understood everything all at once.<br><ruby>他 是 最 高 的 ，我一下子就看到 他了。<rt>Tā shì zuì gāo de, wǒ yīxiàzi jiù kàndào tā le.</rt></ruby><br>He is the tallest. I spotted him right away.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG06EA8		{}
Subj. + 差点 + Predicate<br>我 今天差点儿迟到了。		- Expressing 'almost' using 'chadian'<br>- To say that something badalmosthappened (but didn't), you can add the word 差点 (chàdiǎn) before the verb.  You will also hear 差点儿 (chàdiǎnr) in northern China.  There is no difference in meaning between 差点 and 差点儿.<br>- It might help to understand the literal meaning of the structure.  The word 差 has a lot of meanings. In this case, it means 'to lack,' or 'to be short.' So in Chinese, the way to say 'almost' is to say, 'lacking that little bit.' If that 'little bit' hadn't been lacking, itwould havehappened.  But itwaslacking, so it didn't happen; italmosthappened. Just remember: the fact of what really happened is alwaysNOTthe verb phrase after 差点(儿).<br>- Note that the 'Predicate' part of the structure is usually something bad or something you don't wish for, and that itdidn't happen.<br>- Subj. + 差点 + Predicate<br>- You can put 了 at the end of the sentence for emphasis. In this case, 就 is often used and it's optional.<br>- Subj. + 差点 (+就) + Predicate + 了<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br>- This can get confusing, even though it's really the same pattern (and same logic) with a little added complexity. This pattern goes beyond the difficulty level of the needs of the B1 learner, so to learn more about this usage, seeexpressing 'almost' using 'chadian mei.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6ESWW		{}
都 + Time + 了<br>都九点了，快点 起床 ！		- Expressing 'already' with 'dou'<br>- 都⋯⋯了 (dōu... le) is a pattern used to express that something has already happened, similar to已经 (yǐjīng)⋯⋯了. However, 都⋯⋯了 is used more emphatically, implying that the speaker holds some sort of attitude in relation to the event and is not merely objectively stating the facts, as with 已经⋯⋯了. The two options can actually also be combined in the pattern 都已经⋯⋯了. Here the meaning is the same as 都⋯⋯了.<br>- When 都⋯⋯了 (dōu... le) is used at the beginning of a sentence, it will usually be followed with 还 (hái) or 还在 (hái zài). This implies that the other party should stop some kind of action.<br>- 都 + Time + 了<br><ruby>都九点了，快点 起床 ！<rt>Dōu jiǔ diǎn le, kuài diǎn qǐchuáng!</rt></ruby><br>It's already nine o'clock.

从来 + 都 (是) + Predicate<br>我从来 都是 一个人，已经 习惯了。		- Expressing 'always' with 'conglai'<br>- Although perhaps more often used in the negative to mean 'never,' 从来 (cónglái) can be used with都(dōu) to mean 'always' or 'have always (done).'<br>- Without the negative adverbs不and没,从来takes on the meaning of 'always.'  (Literally, 从来 means something like 'from the beginning,' although no one is really thinking that phrase when they use it.)  When used in the positive, though, it is customary to put the adverb 都 after 从来.<br>- Subj. + 从来 + 都 (是) + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective. It's also quite common to follow 从来都 with an additional是for emphasis.<br><ruby>他从来 都这样 。<rt>Tā cónglái dōu zhèyàng.</rt></ruby><br>He's always like this.<br><ruby>她从来 都这么 晚 睡 。<rt>Tā cónglái dōu zhème wǎn shuì.</rt></ruby><br>She's always gone to bed so late.<br><ruby>他 说话从来 都很 大声 。<rt>Tā shuōhuà cónglái dōu hěn dàshēng.</rt></ruby><br>He's always spoken very loudly.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8KUHG		{}
Reason / Condition ，结果 + Result<br>他 没 好好 复习 ，结果没 通过 考试。		- Expressing 'as a result' with 'jieguo'<br>- 结果 (jiéguǒ) can be used as a conjunction or adverb, meaning 'as a result' or 'consequently.' It normally starts the second half of a sentence and can also introduce an unexpected or undesirable result.<br>- Reason / Condition ，结果 + Result<br><ruby>她 穿 得 很 少 ，结果感冒 了 。<rt>Tā chuān de hěn shǎo, jiéguǒ gǎnmào le.</rt></ruby><br>She didn't dress warmly enough, and as a result, she caught a cold.<br><ruby>我 太 紧张 了 ，结果说 错 了 很 多 。<rt>Wǒ tài jǐnzhāng le, jiéguǒ shuō cuò le hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>I was too nervous.

As a result, he hit someone.<br><hr><br>- Sometimes there is no cause-effect relationship between what comes before and after 结果 (no logical connection). In these sentences, the second half of the sentence usually emphasizes that what actually happened was unexpected or undesired.<br>- Situation ，结果 + [Unexpected Result]<br><ruby>我 去 机场 接 他 ，结果没 接到 他 。<rt>Wǒ qù jīchǎng jiē tā, jiéguǒ méi jiēdào tā.</rt></ruby><br>I went to the airport to pick him up.

I ended up getting drunk.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6B21A		{}
Duration + 没 + Verb + 了<br>他已经一 个 星期没洗澡了。		- Expressing duration of inaction<br>- Saying how long you havenotdone something is not difficult, but the word order is different from theregular pattern for expressing duration. If there's a consistent keyword in this pattern, it's going to be没(méi), since it almost always plays a role.<br>- Remember, this pattern differs from bothsimple pattern for expressing durationand thepattern for ongoing duration.<br>- Subj. + (已经 +) Duration + 没 + Verb + 了<br>- So now the duration comes right after the subject and 了 is at the end of the sentence. The verb has to benegated with 没, as the actionhasn'thappened.<br>- Note that 已经 can be omitted.<br><ruby>他们已经两 天没吃 东西了。<rt>Tāmen yǐjīng liǎng tiān méi chī dōngxi le.</rt></ruby><br>They haven't eating anything for two days already.<br><ruby>我们已经十 年没见了。<rt>Wǒmen yǐjīng shí nián méi jiàn le.</rt></ruby><br>We haven't seen each other for ten years already.<br><ruby>他已经一 个 星期没洗澡了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng yī gè xīngqī méi xǐzǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>He has already gone a whole week without showering.<br><hr><br>- In English, we may say something like, 'I haven't eaten since 9:00 this morning' or 'I haven't been to China since the year 2000.' Note that the Chinese do not tend to say somebody hasn't done something since acertain point in time. Instead, you should either express it as a duration of time that one hasn't done something (as in the above examples), or you can say 'the last time somebody did something was [a certain point in time].'<br><ruby>我 已经 十 年没来 中国了。<rt>Wǒ yǐjīng shí nián méi lái Zhōngguó le.</rt></ruby><br>It's been 10 years since I came to China last.<br><ruby>我上次来 中国是2010 年 。<rt>Wǒ shàngcì lái Zhōngguó shì èr-líng-yī-líng nián.</rt></ruby><br>The last time I came to China was 2010.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGSVF28		{}
互相 + Verb Phrase<br>互相帮助		- Expressing 'each other' with 'huxiang'<br>- When some action is mutual, you can use the word 互相 (hùxiāng). The word 'mutual' feels formal in English, but in Chinese, even everyday phrases such as 'learn from each other' use the word 互相, which expresses this 'each other' aspect.<br>- Usually 互相 (hùxiāng) is used with two-syllable words, and for one-syllable words, some other information will be added after the verb to make it sound more natural (see below for examples of this.)<br>- 互相 + Verb<br><ruby>互相帮助<rt>hùxiāng bāngzhù</rt></ruby><br>Help each other<br><ruby>互相了解<rt>hùxiāng liǎojiě</rt></ruby><br>Know each other<br><ruby>互相伤害<rt>hùxiāng shānghài</rt></ruby><br>Hurt each other<br><hr><br>- Don't use 互相 (hùxiāng) with single-syllable verbs. If you really have to use 互相, you can make the verb longer by adding extra information after it.<br><hr><br>- Note that for some verbs which are inherently 'mutual,' the use of 互相 (hùxiāng) is redundant and unnecessary. So the following phrases are notwrong, but a little strange.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGF00B7		{}
Subj. + Time + 就 + Verb + 了<br>我 昨晚 八 点 半就睡觉了。		- Expressing earliness with 'jiu'<br>- Just as才 (cái) can express lateness, 就 (jiù) can be used to indicate that something happened earlier or sooner than expected.  It can also be used in the near future to indicate something will happen very soon.<br>- When something happens 'right away,' you're talking about 'very soon' in thefuture.<br>- The pattern is as follows:<br>- Subj. + Time + 就 + Verb<br><ruby>我 马上就来 。<rt>Wǒ mǎshàng jiù lái.</rt></ruby><br>I'll be there in a second.<br><ruby>米饭 二十 分钟就好 。<rt>Mǐfàn èrshí fēnzhōng jiù hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>The rice will be ready in 20 minutes.<br><ruby>你们 现在就出门 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen xiànzài jiù chūmén ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you leaving the house right now?<br><hr><br>- Note that it can sometimes be hard to translate the feeling of 'soonness' into English, but in every one of these examples, the time given in the sentencesfeels 'soon'to the speaker.<br>- This use of 就 might be translated 'as early as,' but usually the earliness is not specifically marked in English.<br>- Subj. + [Point in Time] + 就 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>我们 九点 上课 ，他 八点就来了。<rt>Wǒmen jiǔ diǎn shàngkè, tā bā diǎn jiù lái le.</rt></ruby><br>We have class at nine, but he came in at eight.<br><ruby>飞机 十点 起飞 ，他 六点就到 机场了。<rt>Fēijī shí diǎn qǐfēi, tā liù diǎn jiù dào jīchǎng le.</rt></ruby><br>The plane takes off at ten o'clock, but he arrived at the airport at six.<br><ruby>我 昨晚 八 点 半就睡觉了。<rt>Wǒ zuówǎn  bā diǎn bàn jiù  shuìjiào le.</rt></ruby><br>I went to bed at eight thirty last night.<br><hr><br>- Not only can 就 emphasize a 'point in time,' but it can also emphasize a 'time period,' indicating that something happened very quickly.<br>- Subj. + Time Period + 就 + Verb + 了<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>你一 个 晚上就看 完了？<rt>Nǐ yī gè wǎnshang jiù kàn wán le?</rt></ruby><br>It only took you just one night to finish reading it?<br><ruby>他十 分钟就做完了。<rt>Tā shí fēnzhōng jiù zuò wán le.</rt></ruby><br>It only took him ten minutes to finish doing it.<br><hr><br>- From the example sentences it is clear that了naturally occurs with a verb used after 就. This is because verbs following 就 generally have the feeling of being completed.<br>- 早就 means 'long ago,' and is usually used to express a kind of impatience or surprise on the part of the speaker. It comes before the verb.<br><ruby>我早就知道了！<rt>Wǒ zǎo jiù zhīdào le!</rt></ruby><br>I knew that long ago!<br><ruby>她早就结婚了。<rt>Tā zǎo jiù jiéhūn le.</rt></ruby><br>She got married a long time ago.<br><ruby>他们早就分手了。<rt>Tāmen zǎo jiù fēnshǒu le.</rt></ruby><br>They broke up a long time ago.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGKITRZ		{}
Subj. + 够 + Predicate (+ 了)<br>我们 买 了 很 多 菜 ，够吃了。		- Expressing 'enough' with 'gou'<br>- In Chinese the word for 'enough' is 够 (gòu). It also combines with other words and most often comes beforeverbsandadjectives, but there are a limited number of verbs that it can follow as well.<br>- 够 + Verb / Adj. + 了<br>- The了is not strictly required, but it adds a sense of emphasis.<br>- In these examples, 够 (gòu) comes before verbs. You'll notice thatwhois doing the verb towhatis normally just understood in context.<br><ruby>我们 买 了 很 多 菜 ，够吃了。<rt>Wǒmen mǎi le hěn duō cài, gòu chī le.</rt></ruby><br>We bought a lot of food. It's enough for us to eat.<br><ruby>这些 纸够用 吗 ？<rt>Zhèxiē zhǐ gòu yòng ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is this paper enough for us to use?<br><ruby>放心 吧 ，我 带 的 钱够花 。<rt>Fàngxīn ba, wǒ dài de qián gòu huā.</rt></ruby><br>Don't worry. I've brought enough money to spend.<br><hr><br>- When it comes before an adjective, 了 is needed at the end of the sentence.<br><ruby>我 对 你够好了。<rt>Wǒ duì nǐ gòu hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>I've been good enough to you.<br><ruby>别 抱怨 了 ，你够幸运了。<rt>Bié bàoyuàn le, nǐ gòu xìngyùn le.</rt></ruby><br>Stop complaining. You've been lucky enough.<br><hr><br>- In the negative form, you're not going to need a 了 (le).<br>- Subj. + 不 + 够 + Adj. / Verb<br>- Note that 了 can't be used when it's negated.<br><ruby>他 觉得 他 女朋友不 够漂亮 。<rt>Tā juéde tā nǚpéngyou bù gòu piàoliang.</rt></ruby><br>He thinks his girlfriend is not pretty enough.<br><ruby>你 说 得不 够清楚 。<rt>Nǐ shuō de bù gòu qīngchǔ.</rt></ruby><br>You didn't speak clearly enough.<br><ruby>这些 菜不 够吃 ，再 点 几 个 菜 。<rt>Zhèxiē cài bù gòu chī, zài diǎn jǐ gè cài.</rt></ruby><br>This food is not enough for us to eat. Let's order a few more dishes.<br><hr><br>- Translations feel looser here, as the Chinese frequently omits the details about what's not enough for what. The verb and the context makes it clear enough.<br>- Literally, 够了 means 'it's enough.' When the speaker is getting sick of doing something or feeling fed up, 够了 can be applied after a limited number of verbs.<br>- A few common examples:<br><ruby>我受够 了！<rt>Wǒ shòu gòu le!</rt></ruby><br>I've had enough!<br><ruby>天天 吃 外卖 ，我们 都吃够 了。<rt>Tiāntiān chī wàimài, wǒmen dōu chī gòu le.</rt></ruby><br>We eat take-out every day. We're sick of eating it.<br><ruby>你玩够 了没有 ？<rt>Nǐ wán gòu le méiyǒu?</rt></ruby><br>Are you done playing?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG49BE6		{}
Subj. + 终于 + Predicate + 了<br>你终于到了。		- Expressing 'finally' with 'zhongyu'<br>- 终于 (zhōngyú) expresses that something hasfinallyhappened after a long wait. Usually the speaker is looking forward to what is happening at long last, and thus, 终于 (zhōngyú) typically carries a sense of joy or relief.<br>- Unlike the English word 'finally,' 终于 (zhōngyú) can never be used alone. It also can’t be put in front of the subject or at the end of the sentence. 终于 (zhōngyú) needs to be used with了to express that the action is completed.<br>- Subj. + 终于 + Predicate + 了<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>你终于到了！<rt>Nǐ zhōngyú dào le!</rt></ruby><br>You've finally arrived!<br><ruby>我们终于见面了！<rt>Wǒmen zhōngyú jiànmiàn le!</rt></ruby><br>We're finally meeting each other!<br><ruby>你们终于明白了。<rt>Nǐmen zhōngyú míngbai le.</rt></ruby><br>You've finally understood.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG700A5		{}
还是 + Verb<br>我们还是先 吃饭 吧。		- Expressing 'had better' with 'haishi'<br>- One of the ways to use 还是 (háishì) is to have it mean 'you had better,' after having compared two options. Usually there's even a bit of deliberation before the speaker announces what 'it would be better' to do, using 还是.<br>- 还是 as anadverbcan express 'had better' or 'it would be better to.'  The idea is that the speaker has given the matter some thought, and after considering it, has finally come to a decision.  The announcement of this decision will frequently include 还是, and it usually comes before a verb or a subject.<br>- Subj. + 还是 + [Verb Phrase] + 吧<br>- 吧 is often placed after this structure,as it's a suggestion.<br><ruby>还是明天 去 吧 。<rt>Háishì míngtiān qù ba.</rt></ruby><br>We'd better go tomorrow.<br><ruby>还是让 她 进来 吧 。<rt>Háishì ràng tā jìnlái ba.</rt></ruby><br>We'd better let her come in.<br><ruby>你还是快点 走 吧 。<rt>Nǐ háishì kuài diǎn zǒu ba.</rt></ruby><br>You'd better leave now.<br><hr><br>- When the part after 还是 is a negative verb phrase, it's OK to drop the 吧 at the end.<br><ruby>太 贵 了 ，还是别 买 了 。<rt>Tài guì le, háishì bié mǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>It's too expensive. You'd better not buy it.<br><ruby>她 不 想 说 ，还是不要 再 问 了 。<rt>Tā bù xiǎng shuō, háishì bùyào zài wèn le.</rt></ruby><br>She doesn't want to say. We'd better not ask again.<br><ruby>他 一定 不 同意 ，还是别 跟 他 说 了 。<rt>Tā yīdìng bù tóngyì, háishì bié gēn tā shuō le.</rt></ruby><br>He will definitely not agree to it. We'd better not say anything to him.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWAR65		{}
Subj. + 最好 + Predicate<br>你最好先 休息 一下 。		- Expressing 'had better' with 'zuihao'<br>- Sure, 最好 (zuìhǎo) means 'best.' But it can also be used to mean 'it would be best to' or 'had better.' It is often used when giving advice to someone or even politely making demands.<br>- Subj. + 最好 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>你最好先 休息 一下 。<rt>Nǐ zuìhǎo xiān xiūxi yīxià.</rt></ruby><br>You'd better get some rest first.<br><ruby>你们最好给 他 打 个 电话 问 一下 。<rt>Nǐmen zuìhǎo gěi tā dǎ gè diànhuà wèn yīxià.</rt></ruby><br>It would be best for you to give him a call and ask.<br><ruby>那个 地方 不 好 找 ，我们最好查 一下 百度 地图 。<rt>Nàge dìfang bù hǎo zhǎo, wǒmen zuìhǎo chá yīxià Bǎidù dìtú.</rt></ruby><br>It's not easy to find that place. We'd better search for it on Baidu Maps.<br><hr><br>- Subj. + 最好 + 别 / 不要 + Predicate<br><ruby>最好别 去 。<rt>Zuìhǎo bié qù.</rt></ruby><br>You'd better not go.<br><ruby>最好不要 这样 说 。<rt>Zuìhǎo bùyào zhèyàng shuō.</rt></ruby><br>It's best not to say something like this.<br><ruby>晚饭最好不要 吃 那么 多 。<rt>Wǎnfàn zuìhǎo bùyào chī nàme duō.</rt></ruby><br>It's best not to eat so much for dinner.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG35CD7		{}
Condition ，这样 + Result / Purpose<br>这样做 不 对 。		- Expressing 'in this way' with 'zheyang'<br>- 这样 (zhèyàng) is used at the beginning of a phrase to express 'this way' or 'in this way.'<br>- 这样 + Verb<br><ruby>这样做 不 对 。<rt>Zhèyàng zuò bù duì.</rt></ruby><br>Doing it this way is not right.<br><ruby>这样说 不 礼貌 。<rt>Zhèyàng shuō bù lǐmào.</rt></ruby><br>It's not polite to say this.<br><ruby>这样走 过去 更 近 。<rt>Zhèyàng zǒu guòqù gèng jìn.</rt></ruby><br>If you walk over this way, it's closer.<br><hr><br>- This use of 这样 corresponds to 'in this way,' which is another way of expressing 'so that' or 'thus.'<br>- ⋯⋯ ，这样 + 会 / 才 ⋯⋯<br>- You will often see 会 or 才 following 这样 to indicate 'only in this way can or will something happen.'<br><ruby>你 要 多 鼓励 学生 ，这样他们会更 有 自信 。<rt>Nǐ yào duō gǔlì xuéshēng, zhèyàng tāmen huì gèng yǒu zìxìn.</rt></ruby><br>You need to encourage your students more. This will help them become more confident.<br><ruby>父母 应该 多 陪 孩子 ，这样孩子会更 快乐 。<rt>Fùmǔ yīnggāi duō péi háizi, zhèyàng háizi huì gèng kuàilè.</rt></ruby><br>Parents should spend more time with their children. This will make the children happier.<br><ruby>你 要 多 说 ，这样才能 越来越 流利 。<rt>Nǐ yào duō shuō, zhèyàng cái néng yuèláiyuè liúlì.</rt></ruby><br>You need to speak more. Only in this way will you become more and more fluent.<br><hr><br>- This use of 这样 corresponds to 'this way,' as in 'if we do it this way.' Adding 的话 gives the pattern more of a hypothetical 'if' flavor. To make the 'if' even more explicit, you can even add 如果是 before 这样的话.<br>- (如果是 +) 这样的话 ，⋯⋯<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>这样 的话，你 还 想 去 吗 ？<rt>Zhèyàng dehuà, nǐ hái xiǎng qù ma?</rt></ruby><br>If this is the case, do you still want to go?<br><ruby>如果 是这样 的话，麻烦 就 大 了 。<rt>Rúguǒ shì zhèyàng dehuà, máfan jiù dà le.</rt></ruby><br>If this is the case, we're in for a heap of trouble.<br><ruby>我 会 住 在 美国 朋友 的 家里 。这样 的话，我 家人 就 不 那么 担心 我 了 。<rt>Wǒ huì zhù zài Měiguó péngyou de jiā lǐ. Zhèyàng dehuà, wǒ jiārén jiù bù nàme dānxīn wǒ le.</rt></ruby><br>I will stay at my American friend's house when I go to visit the US. This way my family won't worry about me so much.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1F4D1		{}
Subj. + Time + 才 + Verb<br>他 二十五 岁才上 大学 。		- Expressing lateness with 'cai'<br>- To express that something happened later than expected, you can use 才 (cái). In English, this might be expressed with 'as late as' or 'not until.' This form is often used with a time of some sort, like a specific time of day, age, etc. This pattern is essentially the opposite ofusing 就 (jiù) to express earliness.<br>- Subj. + Time + 才 + Verb<br><ruby>我 昨天 晚上 十一 点才到 家 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān wǎnshang shíyī diǎn cái dào jiā.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't arrive at home until eleven o'clock last night.<br><ruby>他 二十 五 岁才上 大学 。<rt>Tā èrshí-wǔ suì cái shàng dàxué.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't go to college until he was 25.<br><ruby>她 四十 岁才结婚 。<rt>Tā sìshí suì cái jiéhūn.</rt></ruby><br>She didn't get married until she was forty.<br><hr><br>- You can use 才 alone with the verb to indicate the lateness when the context is clear:<br><ruby>你 怎么才吃 晚饭 ？已经 十 点 了 。<rt>Nǐ zěnme cái chī wǎnfàn? Yǐjīng shí diǎn le.</rt></ruby><br>How come you are eating dinner now? It's 10 pm.<br><ruby>你 怎么才来 ？我们 等 了 半 个 多 小时 。<rt>Nǐ zěnme cái lái? Wǒmen děng le bàn gè duō xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br>How come you came here so late? We've waited for more than half an hour.<br><hr><br>- Note that verbs following 才 should not take 了.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG3WTCJ		{}
一 + Measure Word + 一 + Measure Word<br>宝宝一天一天 在 长大 。		- Expressing 'one by one' with 'yi'<br>- The expression 'one by one' is also simple in Chinese. It unsurprisingly features the word 一 (yī), but you don't even need the word 'by.' However, the pattern gets complicated somewhat by the concept ofmeasure words.<br>- The most obvious way to express 'one by one' is 一个一个 (yī gè yī gè), and this expression is, in fact, quite common, especially when referring to people doing things 'one by one.' But othermeasure wordscan be used in the same pattern instead of 个.<br>- 一 + Measure Word + 一 + Measure Word (+ Noun)<br>- 个 is the most likely candidate for the 'Measure Word' slot here.<br><ruby>别 吵 ，一个一个 说。<rt>Bié chǎo, yī gè yī gè shuō.</rt></ruby><br>Don't argue. Speak one by one.<br><ruby>别 着急 ，一点一点 做 。<rt>Bié zháojí, yī diǎn yī diǎn zuò.</rt></ruby><br>Don't worry, do it little by little.<br><ruby>请一个 房间一个 房间 检查 。<rt>Qǐng yī gè fángjiān yī gè fángjiān jiǎnchá.</rt></ruby><br>Please inspect room by room.<br><hr><br>- Aside from just meaning 'one by one,' when 一 (yī) is used with ameasure wordthat is a unit of time  like 'day' or 'year,' the meaning changes to 'little by little' ('day by day,' 'year by year') or 'gradually.'<br>- 一 + Time Unit + 一 + Time Unit (+ Noun)<br><ruby>宝宝一天一天 在 长大 。<rt>Bǎobao yī tiān yī tiān zài zhǎngdà.</rt></ruby><br>The baby is growing up day by day.<br><ruby>爸爸 妈妈一年一年 在 变 老 。<rt>Bàba māma yī nián yī nián zài biàn lǎo.</rt></ruby><br>Year by year, mom and dad are growing old.<br><hr><br>- When a measure word phrase like 'one time' is repeated, the meaning also changes. When using averb measure wordlike 次 (cì) or 遍 (biàn), using this pattern can indicate how the action is performed or indicate repetition of the the action.<br>- 一 + [Measure Word] (+ 又) + 一 + [Measure Word]<br>- If the speaker wants to emphasize that the action has been repeated many times, 又 (yòu) can add emphasis.<br><ruby>我一次一次 问，他 就是 什么 都 不 说 。<rt>Wǒ yī cì yī cì wèn, tā jiùshì shénme dōu bù shuō.</rt></ruby><br>I asked him again and again, but he just wouldn't say anything.<br><ruby>我一遍一遍 地 跟 他 解释，他 还是 不 听 。<rt>Wǒ yī biàn yī biàn de gēn tā jiěshì, tā háishì bù tīng.</rt></ruby><br>I explained it to him again and again, but he still won't listen.<br><ruby>你 为什么一遍又一遍 地 听 这 首 歌 ？<rt>Nǐ wèishénme yī biàn yòu yī biàn de tīng zhè shǒu gē?</rt></ruby><br>Why do you listen to this song over and over again?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGBC7A0		{}
就 + Subject + Predicate<br>这 件 事就我 一 个 人 知道 。		- Expressing 'small quantity' with 'jiu'<br>- 就 (jiù) is often translated simply as 'just' or 'only,' but there are some nuances to how it is used.<br>- 就 can also be used to express one person or thing, similar to how we say in English 'just one person' or 'just one left.' It is often paired with 一个 or similar in order to emphasize the small quantity.<br>- 就 + Subj. + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>这 件 事就我 知道 。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì jiù wǒ zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>I'm the only person that knows about this.<br><ruby>我们 都 忘 了 ，就他 还 记得 。<rt>Wǒmen dōu wàng le, jiù tā hái jìde.</rt></ruby><br>We all forgot. Only he still remembers it.<br><ruby>大家 都 下班 了 ，就老板 还 没 走 。<rt>Dàjiā dōu xiàbān le, jiù lǎobǎn hái méi zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone finished work and left. Only the boss hasn't left.<br><hr><br>- In this case, the 就 comes before the verb, and what's being emphasized as 'small quantity' comes after the verb, either as an object or some other kind of small quantity.<br>- Subj. + 就 + [Verb Phrase]<br>- In this structure, the verb phrase is going to include some kind ofmeasure word.<br><ruby>我就去 过 一 次 。<rt>Wǒ jiù qù guo yī cì.</rt></ruby><br>I've only been there once.<br><ruby>我 早饭就吃 了 一 片 面包。<rt>Wǒ zǎofàn jiù chī le yī piàn miànbāo.</rt></ruby><br>I only had a piece of bread for breakfast.<br><ruby>你就点 了 两 个 菜 ？<rt>Nǐ jiù diǎn le liǎng gè cài?</rt></ruby><br>You ordered only two dishes?<br><hr><br>- In this case, 就 means 'only have,' similar in meaning to只有. (In these cases, however, 就有 would not be correct. Just use 就.)<br>- Subj. + 就 + Number + [Measure Word] + Noun<br><ruby>这里就一 个 厕所 ？<rt>Zhèlǐ jiù yī gè cèsuǒ?</rt></ruby><br>Does this place only have one bathroom?<br><ruby>你们 家就一 个 孩子 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen jiā jiù yī gè háizi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Does your family only have one child?<br><ruby>我就一 个 哥哥 。<rt>Wǒ jiù yī gè gēge.</rt></ruby><br>I only have one brother.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPW8PP		{}
先⋯⋯ ，再⋯⋯<br>先洗 手 ，再吃饭 。		- Sequencing with 'xian' and 'zai'<br>- The word再 (zài)actually has a lot of uses, beyond just'again,'and in this pattern it means something like 'and then.'  先⋯⋯，再⋯⋯ (xiān..., zài...) is a pattern used for sequencing events, much like 'first..., then...' in English. This pattern can also include 然后 (ránhòu), meaning 'and after that.'<br>- In the pattern below, 先 means 'first' and 再 has a meaning of 'then' or 'and then.'<br>- 先 ⋯⋯ ，再 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>先洗 手再吃。<rt>Xiān xǐ shǒu zài chī.</rt></ruby><br>Wash your hands first, and then eat.<br><ruby>我 喜欢先洗澡 ，再睡觉 。<rt>Wǒ xǐhuan xiān xǐzǎo, zài shuìjiào.</rt></ruby><br>I prefer to take a bath first and then go to bed.<br><ruby>请 你先买 票再进去。<rt>Qǐng nǐ xiān mǎi piào zài jìnqù.</rt></ruby><br>Please buy a ticket first and then enter.<br><hr><br>- You may have learned that再说 can mean 'in addition.'Well, the usage of 再 here is a more literal combination of 再说, fitting into the 先⋯⋯再⋯⋯ pattern.<br>- So in this usage, 再说 doesn't really mean 'in addition.'  Rather, it most literally means, 'and then we'll talk.'  In other words, 'let's just do this now,' and then after we see the result, we can talk some more about next steps. There's a 'let's see how this goes first' feeling to the expression.<br>- Note that in the pattern below, the sentence normally ends with 再说.<br>- 先 + [Verb Phrase] + 再说<br>- The 再说 part in the following sentences can be a little tricky to translate into English.<br><ruby>先吃饭再 说。<rt>Xiān chīfàn zài shuō.</rt></ruby><br>Let's eat first, then we'll talk.<br><ruby>先休息 一下再说。<rt>Xiān xiūxi yīxià zàishuō.</rt></ruby><br>Let's rest a little first, then we'll see.<br><ruby>你先看 完再说。<rt>Nǐ xiān kàn wán zàishuō.</rt></ruby><br>Finish reading first, and then we'll see.<br><hr><br>- When describing a series of actions, steps, or consecutive events, your Chinese will sound more natural if you can diversify your conjunctions.然后(ránhòu) is most commonly used, a conjunction which means 'and then.' Alternatively, you can use 接着 (jīezhe), as a conjunction that means 'next,' or 'afterwards.'<br>- A longer example to help you understand how they can all work together:<br><ruby>今天 早上 我 起床 以后先准备 早饭 ，再叫 孩子们 起床 ，接着我们 一起 吃早饭 ，然后我 送 他们 去 学校 。<rt>Jīntiān zǎoshang wǒ qǐchuáng yǐhòu xiān zhǔnbèi zǎofàn, zài jiào háizi men qǐchuáng, jiēzhe wǒmen yīqǐ chī zǎofàn, ránhòu wǒ sòng tāmen qù xuéxiào.</rt></ruby><br>After I got up this morning, I first prepared breakfast, and then I woke up the kids. Next, we ate breakfast together. After that, I took them to school. <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLJM55		{}
Subj. + 老 (是 ) + Verb<br>你 怎么老是加班 ？		- Using 'always' as a complaint with 'laoshi'<br>- We have a few ways to say 'always' in Chinese, and one of them is to use the word 老是 (lǎoshì). 老是 is usually used in the context of a complaint, like how your sister is 'always' hogging the bathroom.<br>- 老是 is an adverb, usually translated into English as 'always.' It expresses that an action or a condition constantly repeats or continues and can be interchanged withthe word 总是. However, 老是 also has an unsatisfied or frustrated tone.<br>- 老 (是) + Predicate<br>- You can also use 老 instead of 老是. Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be averbor an adjective.<br>- When 老是 is used together with anadjective, 老是 is usually followed by anadverbsuch as 不, 很, 非常, 这么, 那 etc.<br><ruby>你 怎么老是加班 ？<rt>Nǐ zěnme lǎoshì jiābān?</rt></ruby><br>Why are you always working late?<br><ruby>那个 孩子老说 脏话 。<rt>Nàge háizi lǎo shuō zānghuà.</rt></ruby><br>That kid always says bad words.<br><ruby>你 怎么老是不 高兴 ？<rt>Nǐ zěnme lǎoshì bù gāoxìng? </rt></ruby><br>How are you always unhappy?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGII66E		{}
才 + Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>这 个 班才两 个 学生 。		- Using 'cai' for small numbers<br>- The character 才 (cái) can be used to emphasize that a number is small, or less than expected.<br>- In this case, 才 means 'is only' or 'only have.'<br>- 才 + Number + [Measure Word] + Noun<br>- In English, we often express this by using 'only' or 'just' to emphasize that the number is small.<br>- 才 + Verb + Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>- In this pattern, adding a 了 after the verb is optional.<br><ruby>她才来 了 两 个 月 。<rt>Tā cái lái le liǎng gè yuè.</rt></ruby><br>She's been here for only two months.<br><ruby>这 家 店 关门 了 ？可是 它才开业 一 个 星期 。<rt>Zhè jiā diàn guānmén le? Kěshì tā  cái kāiyè yī gè xīngqī.</rt></ruby><br>This shop is out of business? But it's only been one week since it opened.<br><ruby>已经 两 天 了 ，你才看完 一 页 ？<rt>Yǐjīng liǎng tiān le, nǐ cái kàn wán yī yè?</rt></ruby><br>It's been two days and you only finished reading one page?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGYW5RS		{}
也都 + Verb / Adj.<br>他们也 都是 法国 人 。		- Using 'ye' and 'dou' together<br>- If you are trying to call attention to similarities between multiple things, you will want to use 也 (yě) first followed by 都 (dōu) to express that these multiple things have something in common.<br>- When using 也 (yě) and 都 (dōu) in the same sentence, remember to put 也 (yě) first:<br>- Subj. + 也都 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>我 很 好 ，我 的 家人也 都很 好 。<rt>Wǒ hěn hǎo, wǒ de jiārén yě dōu hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I'm good.

那么 / 这么 + Adj.<br>你 怎么那么忙 ？		- Adjectives with 'name' and 'zheme'<br>- In  English, the words 'that' and 'so' are often used to emphasize the degree of an adjective (ex. 'he is so tall' or 'the food is so good'). In Chinese, 那么 (nàme) and 这么 (zhème) serve the same function.<br>- All you have to do to use this grammar structure is put the 那么 or 这么 in front of the adjective.<br>- Subj. + 那么 / 这么 + Adj.<br>- You could think of 这么 as 'this' or 'so,' and 那么 as 'that' or 'so.'<br><ruby>他 说得这么快 ，你们 听 得 懂 吗 ？<rt>Tā shuō de zhème kuài,  nǐmen tīng de dǒng ma?</rt></ruby><br>He speaks so fast.

How about we go tomorrow?<br><hr><br>- You might be thinking that since 这 ('this') and 那 ('that') have totally different meanings, how could they be used in an essentially interchangeable way? Well, there are some differences. 这么 is used when the subject is close by (either in space or in time), when you would say 'this' or 这个. On the other hand, if the subject is far away (or in the past), you would likely use 那么.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNKKP6		{}

When referring to a list of friends in informal contexts there is no problem using 什么的.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGDIDAC		{}
像 ⋯⋯ 之类的 + Category<br>你 喜欢《星球大战》之类的电影 吗 ？		- Expressing 'stuff like that' with 'zhileide'<br>- 之类的 (zhī lèi de) can be translated as 'and so on' or 'and stuff like that.'

⋯⋯ 等 / 等等<br>长城、故宫等地方 都 是 北京 有名 的 景点 。		- Non-exhaustive lists with 'dengdeng'<br>- 等等 (děng děng) or simply 等 (děng), is just like saying “and so on” or “etc.” in English, but it's just a bit more formal.  Both are placed after listing a series of items (generally with a list that exceeds two items).<br>- The basic structure is easy. Just make a list of things and add 等 (děng) or 等等 (děng děng) to the end of the list. It's the same as in English when we use 'etc.' at the end of a list, except in Chinese you don't put a final comma before the 等 or 等等.<br>- A1，A2 ⋯⋯ 等 / 等等<br><ruby>西瓜、菠萝、葡萄等等，我 都 喜欢  吃 。<rt>Xīguā, bōluó, pútao, děngděng,  wǒ dōu xǐhuan chī.</rt></ruby><br>Watermelons, pineapples, grapes, and so on...

⋯⋯ ，不过 ⋯⋯<br>他 的 汉语 口语 不错 ，不过不 认识 汉字 。		- A softer 'but' with 'buguo'<br>- Instead of just using可是 or 但是, you can also use the softer and more informal 不过 (búguò), which also means 'but.'<br>- Just like its counterparts, 不过 is a conjunction that comes between two distinct clauses.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，不过 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>这 件 衣服 我 很 喜欢 ，不过有点 贵 。<rt> Zhè jiàn yīfu wǒ hěn xǐhuan, bùguò yǒudiǎn guì.</rt></ruby><br>I like this piece of clothing, but it's a little bit expensive.<br><ruby>这 家 餐厅 我 没 去 过 ，不过我 听说 还 不错 。<rt>Zhè jiā cāntīng wǒ méi qù guo, bùguò wǒ tīngshuō hái bùcuò.</rt></ruby><br>I've never been to this restaurant, but I heard it's pretty good.<br><ruby>这个 学生 很 聪明 ，不过有点 懒 。<rt>Zhège xuéshēng hěn cōngming, bùguò yǒudiǎn lǎn.</rt></ruby><br>This student is very smart, but he's a little lazy.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGA0S4T		{}
Reason / Situation，要不 + Suggestion + 吧<br>下雨 了，要不明天 再 去 吧 。		- Expressing 'how about' with 'yaobu'<br>- Colloquially, 要不 (yàobù) can be used for making suggestions, like how we use 'how about' in English.<br>- 要不 can be used as an indirect way of giving a suggestion, as the speaker is using 要不 to seek consent of the listener. When using 要不 in this way, it can come either at the beginning of the sentence or in the middle, after explaining the situation.<br>- Reason / Situation ，要不 + Suggestion<br>- or<br>- 要不 + Suggestion ，Reason / Situation<br><ruby>大家 都 有点 累 了，要不休息 一会儿吧。<rt>Dàjiā dōu yǒudiǎn lèi le, yàobù xiūxi yīhuìr ba.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone is a little tired.

How about we meet up next week?<br><hr><br>- When 要不 (yàobù) is used to mean 'otherwise,” it's a shortened form of 要不然 (yàobùrán), which literally means 'if that's not the case.'<br>- Note 要不 (yàobù) can also be used to offer 'either/or' choices to others, similar to要么(yàome).<br>- Here are a few examples of  要不 used as 'otherwise':<br><ruby>你 先 吃 吧 ，要 不然饭 就 凉 了 。<rt>Nǐ xiān chī ba, yàobùrán fàn jiù liáng le.</rt></ruby><br>You should eat; otherwise, the food will get cold.<br><ruby>打车 吧 ，要不会 迟到 的 。<rt>Dǎchē ba, yàobù huì chídào de.</rt></ruby><br>Take a taxi.

那么⋯⋯<br>他 不 听 ，那我 应该 怎么办 ？		- Expressing 'then…' with 'name'<br>- English speakers often like to connect sentences together with 'so...' and also try to do this in Chinese with the word 所以 (suǒyǐ). In reality, they should mostly be using 那么 (nàme).<br>- When expressing 'so...,' you can use 那么 or 那 in order to begin a judgment or result from previous context. An example of this in English would be: 'so, what should we do?'<br>- Situation ，那么 + Suggestion / Decision<br><ruby>他 不 听 ，那我 应该 怎么办 ？<rt>Tā bù tīng, nà wǒ yīnggāi zěnme bàn?</rt></ruby><br>He won't listen.

通过 / 用 + Method + 来 + Verb Phrase<br>用这 种 方法来赚钱 ，真 丢人 。		- Using 'lai' to connect two verb phrases<br>- The word 来 (lái) can be used to connect two verb phrases, relating the actions to each other. It can be translated as 'in order to' or 'so that,' and it can help in explaining reasoning.<br>- Connecting two verb phrases is very straightforward. All you need to do is place 来 in between them. This has the meaning of doing the first verb to achieve the second verb and is often used with words expressing a way or a method, e.g. 通过 (tōngguò) or 用 (yòng).<br>- 通过 / 用 + Method + 来 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>用这 种 方法来赚钱 ，真 丢人 。<rt>Yòng zhè zhǒng fāngfǎ lái zhuànqián, zhēn diūrén.</rt></ruby><br>It's shameful to earn money in this way.<br><ruby>很 多 年轻 人用手机 APP来点 外卖 。<rt>Hěn duō niánqīng rén yòng shǒujī APP lái diǎn wàimài.</rt></ruby><br>A lot of young people use apps on their cell phones to order food.<br><ruby>父母 不 应该 经常用钱来奖励 孩子 。<rt>Fùmǔ bù yīnggāi jīngcháng yòng qián lái jiǎnglì háizi.</rt></ruby><br>Parents shouldn't often use money to reward their children.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGBZ578		{}
MW + MW<br>个 个都 很 好。		- Reduplication of measure words<br>- If you know what ameasure wordis and how to use it, you may be ready for this pattern, where the measure word can repeat, or 'reduplicate.' It's not a terribly common structure, but the two most common examples of it are 个个 and 天天. It adds the meaning of 'every' to the noun that follows.<br>- The reduplicated measure word should precede the predicate of the sentence, often a verb phrase or an adjective.<br>- Subj + MW + MW + Predicate<br>- By far, the most commonly reduplicated measure words are 个个 (meaning 'every one' of something) and 天天 (meaning 'every day'). For less common measure words, the meaning is still the same: 'every' of something (for which the measure word applies).<br><ruby>公司 的 员工个 个都 很 好。<rt>Gōngsī de yuángōng gè gè dōu hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>他们个 个都 不 喜欢 打 游戏 。<rt>Tāmen gè gèdōu bù xǐhuan dǎ yóuxì.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>这个 星期 他天 天给 我 打 电话 。<rt>Zhège xīngqī tātiān tiān gěi wǒ dǎ diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br><br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6120A		{}
Event + 之前 / 之后 ，⋯⋯<br>出国之前，他 和 女朋友 分手了 。		- Expressing 'before' and 'after' with 'zhiqian' and 'zhihou'<br>- The words 'before' and 'after' can be expressed using 之前 (zhīqián) and 之后 (zhīhòu). They are very similar to以前(yǐqián) and以后(yǐhòu), but are slightly more formal.<br>- In this pattern, 之前 and 之后 come at the start of a sentence, right after mention of some kind of event or thing that happened.<br>- Event + 之前 / 之后 ，⋯⋯<br><ruby>来 中国之前，我 的 汉语 很 一般 。<rt>Lái Zhōngguó zhīqián, wǒ de Hànyǔ hěn yībān.</rt></ruby><br>Before I came to China, my Chinese was really mediocre.<br><ruby>下班之后给 我  打 个 电话 。<rt>Xiàbān zhīhòu gěi wǒ dǎ gè diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>Give me a call after you get off work.<br><ruby>吃 完 饭之后去 看 电影 吧 ？<rt>Chī wán fàn zhīhòu qù kàn diànyǐng ba?</rt></ruby><br>What about going to the movies after eating dinner?<br><hr><br>- In this pattern, 之前 and 之后 usually come at the start of a phrase, in the middle of a sentence.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，之前 / 之后 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>他 在 英国 读 完 了 大学 ，之后回 上海 了 。<rt>Tā zài Yīngguó dú wán le dàxué, zhīhòu huí Shànghǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>He finished university in England.

He was on vacation before.<br><hr><br>- One difference between the two pairs is that 之前/之后 feel more formal simply because they contain之, which is a word common in classical Chinese. Both words are still used in everyday spoken Chinese, however.<br>- In addition, while all four words can mean 'before and 'after' (referring to time), 之前/之后 also sometimes mean 'in front of' or 'behind,' referring to physical location. (以前/以后 aren't used in this way, but the single characters 前/后 are.) We haven't included examples of the 'physical location' usage here, because it's less common and more formal.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGTD3L3		{}
Time / Event + 以来 ，⋯⋯<br>今年 八月以来，这里 一直 没 下 过 雨 。		- Expressing 'ever since' with 'yilai'<br>- You can express 'ever since' in Chinese using 以来 (yǐlái) after a time in the past. Just the word 来 (lái) can also play a similar role.<br>- To express 'ever since,' all one needs to do is put 以来 after a specific event or time. It expresses what has happened since the stated event until the time that the speaker talks (in other words, referring to a certain continuous time period leading up to the present).<br>- This grammar pattern is usually used to start a statement.<br>- Time / Event + 以来 ，⋯⋯<br>- Although we won't go into detail here, note that when using 以来 in a more formal or written context, you canadd 自, 从, or 自从(or other similar words) before the time or event to make it into a 'sandwich pattern.'<br><ruby>今年 八月以来，这里 一直 没 下 过 雨 。<rt>Jīnnián Bāyuè yǐlái, zhèlǐ yīzhí méi xià guo yǔ.</rt></ruby><br>It hasn't rained since August of this year.<br><ruby>结婚以来，我们 没 吵 过 架 。<rt>Jiéhūn yǐlái, wǒmen méi chǎo guo jià.</rt></ruby><br>Since we got married we haven't had a fight.<br><ruby>上 大学以来，他 变 了 很 多 。<rt>Shàng dàxué yǐlái, tā biàn le hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>Since starting college, he's changed a lot.<br><hr><br>- Using 来 to mean 'ever since' is basically the same as 以来. However, there is one key difference: you can only use 来 after a length of time, rather than a specific date. In other words, it needs to be used with a certain number of years, months, days, hours, etc. In English, this would be like saying 'Ever since three days ago, I've had a constant headache.' It doesn't have to be a specific number either; it could be 'a few' (几).<br>- Time Period + 来 ，⋯⋯<br>- This form cannot be used with 自, 从, or 自从 (or other similar words).<br><ruby>十 年来，房价 一直 在 涨 。<rt>Shí nián lái, fángjià yīzhí zài zhǎng.</rt></ruby><br>For the past decade, housing prices have been continuously going up.<br><ruby>几 年来，我们 公司 的 收入 一直 在 增加 。<rt>Jǐ nián lái, wǒmen gōngsī de shōurù yīzhí zài zēngjiā.</rt></ruby><br>Our company's income has been steadily increasing over the past few years.<br><ruby>实习 几 个 月来，我 学到 了 很 多 。<rt>Shíxí jǐ gè yuè lái, wǒ xuédào le hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>I've learned a lot from my internship during the last few months.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNEMXP		{}
Time + 时<br>考试时不要 说话 。		- Expressing 'when' with 'shi'<br>- By now you should nowhow to express 'when' using 的时候 (de shíhou). But there's also a slightly shorter, more formal way to do it: simply use 时 (shí) all by itself. (No 的!)<br>- Time + 时 ，Subj. ⋯⋯<br>- Astime wordscan appearbefore or after the subject, you can also place the 'Time + 时' phrase after the subject.<br><ruby>考试时不要 说话 。<rt>Kǎoshì shí bùyào shuōhuà.</rt></ruby><br>Don't talk when you're taking a test.<br><ruby>我 面试时经常 会 问 这个 问题 。<rt>Wǒ miànshì shí jīngcháng huì wèn zhège wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>I often ask this question during job interviews.<br><ruby>会议 结束时老板 才 来 。<rt>Huìyì jiéshù shí lǎobǎn cái lái.</rt></ruby><br>The boss didn't show up until the meeting was over.<br><hr><br>- There are also two great examples of this pattern in the poem 《远和近》 by Gu Cheng (顾城) below:<br>- 你<br>- 一会看我<br>- 一会看云<br>- 我觉得<br>- 你看我时很远<br>- 你看云时很近	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGGL59D		{}
⋯⋯ ，后来 ⋯⋯<br>开始 他 不 同意， 但后来同意了。		- Sequencing past events with 'houlai'<br>- The word 后来 (hòulái) is used to sequence past events in the same way that 'afterward' is in English. Something very important to note is that 后来 can only be used with two eventsthat have already occurred.<br>- [Past Event 1] ，后来 ，[Past Event 2]<br>- Here are some examples of this pattern in action:<br><ruby>他 说 他 会 来 ，后来又 说 不 来 了 。<rt>Tā shuō tā huì lái, hòulái yòu shuō bù lái le.</rt></ruby><br>He said he would come, but later he said that he's not coming.<br><ruby>他们 上周 吵架 了 ，后来和好 了 。<rt>Tāmen shàng zhōu chǎojià le, hòulái hé hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>They had a fight last week, and they made up afterwards.<br><ruby>他 以前 是 厨师 ，后来当 了 老板 。<rt>Tā yǐqián shì chúshī, hòulái dāng le lǎobǎn.</rt></ruby><br>He used to be a chef.

Denominator + 分之 + Numerator<br>在 我们 班 ，外国 学生 占 三分 之一 。		- Expressing fractions with 'fenzhi'<br>- 分之 (fēn zhī) is used to express fractions in Chinese. When expressing a fraction, the denominator is always said before the numerator. This pattern is also the way percentages are expressed in Chinese.<br>- So '½' is read 二分之一 (èr fēn zhī yī), literally '1 of 2 portions.' Note the order: it'sNOT一分之二 (yī fēn zhī èr). So '¾' is 四分之三 (sì fēn zhī sān), and '⅚'  is 六分之五 (liù fēn zhī wǔ). To say a percentage, for example, 50 percent, you would say 百分之五十 (bǎi fēn zhī wǔshí), which is literally the same as how you would pronounce the equivalent fraction '50 hundredths.'<br>- Denominator + 分之 + Numerator<br>- Remember that thedenominatoris thebottomnumber in a fraction, but it comesfirstin spoken Chinese. Knowing that this order actually totally fits the overall 'big to small' Chinese cultural pattern might help you to remember.<br><ruby>我 的 手机 电量 只 有 百分 之五 了 。<rt>Wǒ de shǒujī diànliàng zhǐ yǒu bǎi fēn zhī wǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>My phone only has 5% power left.<br><ruby>这个 文件 已经 下载 了 三分 之二 。<rt>Zhège wénjiàn yǐjīng xiàzǎi le sān fēn zhī èr.</rt></ruby><br>This document is two-thirds downloaded.<br><ruby>这 篇 文章 有 五分 之三 是 抄 别人 的 。<rt>Zhè piān wénzhāng yǒu wǔ fēn zhī sān shì chāo biérén de.</rt></ruby><br>Three fifths of this article has been copied from others.<br><hr><br>- This structure is what you'll often see in news stories that use statistics.

Number + 多<br>三 十多岁		- Indicating a number in excess<br>- A number in excess of a certain amount is expressed by adding '多' (duō) to the end of a number.

Confirmation + Question + 吗 ？<br>你 要 什么吗?		- Advanced yes-no questions with 'ma'<br>- The question particle 吗 (ma) is a very simple way toconvert simple statements into 'yes/no' questions, and beginners will learnnot to use 吗 with other question words, because it's redundant. More advanced students, however, will note that 吗 has some more complicated structures thatdoinvolve combining 吗 with question words in order to ask very specific types of confirming questions.<br>- You'll remember that this is the simple pattern for yes/no questions:<br>- Statement + 吗 ？<br>- If you embed aquestion that uses a question wordinstead of a statement, you can create a more complex kind of 'confirming' 吗 (ma) question:<br>- Confirmation + Question + 吗 ？<br>- The 'Confirmation' part include typically contains some kind of 'verb of understanding' such as 知道 (zhīdào),了解 (liǎojiě), 明白 (míngbai), 认识 (rènshi), etc. Examples of common question words to use in the 'Question' part include 什么 (shénme), 谁 (shéi), and 哪里 (nǎlǐ). Then '吗' (ma) can still be added at the end of the question, turning the whole structure into a kind of confirmation yes/no question.<br><ruby>这 是 什么 ？<rt>Zhè shì shénme?</rt></ruby><br>What is this?<br><ruby>你知道这 是 什么吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào zhè shì shénme ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know what this is?<br><hr><br><ruby>他 是 谁 ？<rt>Tā shì shéi?</rt></ruby><br>Who is he?<br><ruby>你知道他 是 谁吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào tā shì shéi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know who he is?<br><hr><br><ruby>他 叫 什么 名字 ？<rt>Tā jiào shénme míngzi?</rt></ruby><br>What is his name?<br><ruby>你知道他 叫 什么 名字吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào tā jiào shénme míngzi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know what his name is?<br><hr><br><ruby>她 住 在 哪儿 ？<rt>Tā zhù zài nǎr?</rt></ruby><br>Where does she live?<br><ruby>她说 过她 住 在 哪儿吗？<rt>Tā shuō guo tā zhù zài nǎr ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did she say where she lives?<br><hr><br><ruby>这个 标志 是 什么 意思 ？<rt>Zhège biāozhì shì shénme yìsi?</rt></ruby><br>What does this symbol mean?<br><ruby>你们明白这个 标志 是 什么 意思吗？<rt>Nǐmen míngbai zhège biāozhì shì shénme yìsi ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you all understand what this symbol means?<br><hr><br><ruby>我们 想 要 什么 ？<rt>Wǒmen xiǎng yào shénme?</rt></ruby><br>What do we want?<br><ruby>他问 过我们 想 要 什么吗？<rt>Tā wèn guo wǒmen xiǎng yào shénme ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did he ask what we want?<br><hr><br><ruby>你 的 问题 是 什么 ？<rt>Nǐ de wèntí shì shénme?</rt></ruby><br>What is your question?<br><ruby>你 能再 说 一 遍你 的 问题 是 什么吗？<rt>Nǐ néng zài shuō yī biàn nǐ de wèntí shì shénme ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you repeat what your question is?<br><hr><br><ruby>他 是 什么 时候 开始 学 中文 的 ？<rt>Tā shì shénme shíhou kāishǐ xué Zhōngwén de?</rt></ruby><br>When did he start to learn Chinese?<br><ruby>你知道他 是 什么 时候 开始 学 中文 的吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào tā shì shénme shíhou kāishǐ xué Zhōngwén de ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know when he started to learn Chinese?<br><hr><br><ruby>这 是 在 哪儿 买 的 ？<rt>Zhè shì zài nǎr mǎi de?</rt></ruby><br>Where did you buy this?<br><ruby>你 能告诉我 这 是 在 哪儿 买 的吗？<rt>Nǐ néng gàosu wǒ zhè shì zài nǎr mǎi de ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you tell me where you bought this?<br><hr><br><ruby>老板 的 孩子 多大 了？<rt>Lǎobǎn de háizi duō dà le?</rt></ruby><br>How old is the boss's child now?<br><ruby>你知道老板 的 孩子 多大 了吗？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào lǎobǎn de háizi duō dà le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know how old the boss's child is now?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGI9WXT		{}
Verb + 着<br>我 读 ，你 听着。		- Aspect particle 'zhe'<br>- The particle 着 (zhe) is one way of indicating thecontinuous aspectin Mandarin Chinese (another common way isusing the adverb 在 in front of verbs).  You may have heard that the Chinese particle 着 added onto the end of verbs is similar to the use of-ingin English.  This isn't particularly helpful, however, because the use of 着 in Chinese is not nearly so commonly used, and can also be quite idiomatic.<br>- The main idea here is that the action won't just happen and stop immediately; it will continue for a while.<br>- Verb + 着<br>- This basic pattern is often used with commands involving certain verbs where the action persists for a while.<br><ruby>我 读 ，你 听着。<rt>Wǒ dú, nǐ tīng zhe.</rt></ruby><br>I'll read, and you listen.<br><ruby>我们 做 ，你们 看着。<rt>Wǒmen zuò, nǐmen kàn zhe.</rt></ruby><br>We will do it, and you all watch.<br><ruby>你们 坐着，我 马上 回来 。<rt>Nǐmen zuò zhe, wǒ mǎshàng huílái.</rt></ruby><br>Sit for a while. I'll be right back.<br><hr><br>- This pattern is used when you want to use one verb to describe howanotheraction is performed.<br>- Verb 1 + 着 + Verb 2<br>- Note that thefirst verb(followed by 着) describes thestate; the second verb is the action verb. In this case, the '-ing' translation can be useful for the state.<br>- Note:If you want to make a sentence where both verbs are action verbs (neither is truly a state), then you don't want this pattern; you want一边⋯⋯，一边⋯⋯ (yībiān..., yībiān...).<br>- While it's true that the 'full progressive pattern' can make use of 着, this is not a pattern you're going to want to use all the time.<br>- The verbs most commonly used with 着 are the ones below:<br>- Certain verbs tend to take 着 more frequently than others, and what the 着 exactly isdoingmight not be apparent at all.  It's best to think of these usages as set phrases.<br>- There's also one colloquial usage of 着 that's often chosen for special treatment by Chinese textbooks, so we'll cover it here as well:<br>- Subj. + 是 + Verb + 着 + 玩 + 的<br>- This pattern may look like that 'doing an action in a particular state' pattern already covered above, but in practice it doesn't really work that way.  It just means '[Verb] for fun' or '[Verb] as a joke.'<br><ruby>你 不要 生气 ，我 是 说着玩 的 。<rt>Nǐ bùyào shēngqì, wǒ shì shuō zhe wán de!</rt></ruby><br>Don't be mad.

Statement + 嘛<br>大家 有 话 就 说嘛。		- Expressing the self-evident with 'ma'<br>- The particle 嘛 (ma) is a sentence-final particle identical in pronunciation to the simple'yes/no question' particle 吗 (ma)you learned back in the day, but with a rather different function. It can be used when the speaker feels what he is saying is obvious (from his point of view).<br>- Statement + 嘛	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVMC4B		{}
Option 1吧 ，⋯⋯ ；Option 2 吧 ，⋯⋯<br>不 说吧，他 还 会 做 错 ；说吧，他 肯定 不 高兴 。		- Reviewing options with 'ba'<br>- When 吧 (ba) is used twice in a sentence, it is used to list two options that the speaker is debating. It gives the sentence an indecisive feel, as though the speaker doesn't know which one to choose. This construction often has a negative connotation, since the options usually are not ideal.<br>- Option 1 + 吧 ，⋯⋯ ；Option 2 + 吧 ，⋯⋯<br>- If this structure doesn't seem clear to you, the examples will help.<br><ruby>冬天 去吧，太 冷 ；夏天 去吧，太 热 。<rt>Dōngtiān qù ba, tài lěng; xiàtiān qù ba, tài rè.</rt></ruby><br>If we go in the winter, it's too cold.

⋯⋯的<br>我 不 会 骗 你的。		- Using 'de' (modal particle)<br>- The particle 的 (de) is most often astructural particle, but it can also be a sentence-final particle which indicates that the speaker is certain about what he is saying.  When it serves this purpose, it's expressing a type of 'mood' and thus is called a 'modal particle.'<br>- Statement + 的<br>- Frequently, the statement will include 会 (huì) or 一定会 (yīdìng huì) to emphasize the speaker's certainty.<br><ruby>他 会 好的。<rt>Tā huì hǎo de.</rt></ruby><br>He will get better.<br><ruby>你 可以的。<rt>Nǐ kěyǐ de.</rt></ruby><br>You can do this.<br><ruby>她 一定 会 来的。<rt>Tā yīdìng huì lái de.</rt></ruby><br>She's definitely coming.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG19S1M		{}
关于 + Obj. ，⋯⋯<br>关于中国 历史 ，我 知道 的 不 多 。		- Expressing 'about' with 'guanyu'<br>- 关于 (guānyú) means 'about.' It can be used in a few ways, often marking a topic of a statement or modifying a noun.<br>- As an adverb/adverbial clause, it can only be placed at the beginning of the sentence.<br>- 关于 + Obj. ，⋯⋯<br><ruby>关于中国 历史，我 知道 的 不 多。<rt>Guānyú Zhōngguó lìshǐ, wǒ zhīdào de bù duō.</rt></ruby><br>As for Chinese history, I don't know a lot.<br><ruby>关于这 次 考试，我 还 有 几 个 问题 要 问。<rt>Guānyú zhè cì kǎoshì, wǒ hái yǒu jǐ gè wèntí yào wèn.</rt></ruby><br>As for this exam, I still have a few questions that I need to ask.<br><ruby>关于这个 问题，你们 还是 问 他 吧。<rt>Guānyú zhège wèntí, nǐmen háishì wèn tā ba.</rt></ruby><br>As for this question, you'd better ask him.<br><hr><br>- As an attributive modifier, 关于 (guānyú) is placed before the noun phrase (rather than after, as in English), and you should always add a 的.<br>- 关于 ⋯⋯ 的 + Noun<br><ruby>网上 有 很 多关于这 件 事情 的 评论 。<rt>Wǎngshang yǒu hěn duō guānyú zhè jiàn shìqing de pínglùn.</rt></ruby><br>There are lots of comments about this matter online.<br><ruby>他 写 过 很 多关于男女 平等 的 文章 。<rt>Tā xiě guo hěn duō guānyú nánnǚ píngděng de wénzhāng.</rt></ruby><br>He wrote many articles about gender equality.<br><ruby>汉语 有 很 多关于饮食 的 成语 。<rt>Hànyǔ yǒu hěn duō guānyú yǐnshí de chéngyǔ.</rt></ruby><br>There are lots of idioms about food in Chinese.<br><hr><br>- The word 'about' often follows verbs in English, such as 'talk about' or 'ask about.' In Chinese, however, this 'about' meaning is built into the verb and no additional 'about' word is needed, much like we don't say 'discuss about' in English.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>我们 聊聊 你 的 新 工作 吧 。<rt>Wǒmen liáoliao nǐ de xīn gōngzuò ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's talk about your new job.<br><ruby>今天 开会 要 说说 公司 下 个 月 的 培训 。<rt>Jīntiān kāihuì yào shuōshuo gōngsī xià gè yuè de péixùn.</rt></ruby><br>Today, we need to hold a meeting about the company training next month.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG49889		{}
直到 + Time / Event ，Subj. + 才 ⋯⋯<br>直到十二 点 半 ，我 才 做 完 作业 。		- Expressing 'all the way until' with 'zhidao'<br>- 直到 (zhídào) is for describing a time frame that began in the past and continued until a point closer to the present. It is like the English phrase, 'all the way until.' It can be used in an affirmative or negative form, expressing that something has taken a while or is late. The word 才 (cái) often teams up with 直到, and serves toemphasize the lateness aspect.<br>- In the positive form, which uses 才, it may be more natural in English to express the idea as 'not until... did' something happen.<br>- 直到 + Time / Event ，Subj. + 才 ⋯⋯<br>- This subject can also be placed before 直到.<br><ruby>直到十二 点 半 ，我才做 完 作业 。<rt>Zhídào shí'èr diǎn bàn, wǒ cái zuò wán zuòyè.</rt></ruby><br>It wasn't until twelve thirty in the morning that I finished my homework.<br><ruby>直到半 个 月 以后 ，我 的 感冒才好 。<rt>Zhídào bàn gè yuè yǐhòu, wǒ de gǎnmào cái hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>It took me half a month to recover from the cold.<br><ruby>她直到十八 岁才见到 亲生 父母 。<rt>Tā zhídào shíbā suì cái jiàndào qīnshēng fùmǔ.</rt></ruby><br>It wasn't until she was eighteen that she met her biological parents.<br><hr><br>- 直到 + Time / Event ，Subj. + 都  + 不 / 没 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>直到他 搬 到 上海 ，我们都 没见 过 。<rt>Zhídào tā bān dào Shànghǎi, wǒmen dōu méi jiàn guo.</rt></ruby><br>We didn't meet until he moved to Shanghai.<br><ruby>他们 是 同学 ，但是直到毕业 ，都 没说 过 话 。<rt>Tāmen shì tóngxué, dànshì zhídào bìyè, dōu méi shuō guo huà.</rt></ruby><br>They were classmates, but they had never spoken until they graduated.<br><ruby>直到电影 结束 ，他都 没来 。<rt>Zhídào diànyǐng jiéshù, tā dōu méi lái.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't show up until the movie was over.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC6E1C		{}
Subj. + 给 + Recipient + Verb Phrase<br>妈妈 在给孩子 们 做饭 。		- Expressing 'for' with 'gei'<br>- The preposition 给 (gěi) can mean 'for,' as in, 'everything I do, I do itforyou.' You can also think of it as meaning 'give,' like to give a service or to give something to someone. In this case, the default position of the character is before the verb, although it sometimes comes after, depending on the verb.<br>- The meaning of 给 is very similar to为(wèi) in Chinese, but 给 is more informal than 为, and there are many cases where it's simply based on convention and general practice to decide to use one or the other.<br>- Subj. + 给 + Recipient + [Verb Phrase]<br>- Note that the 'recipient' in the pattern above is usually a person but isn't necessarily a person. It could be an animal, company, or any number of other types of recipients.<br><ruby>给客人倒茶。<rt>Gěi kèrén dàochá.</rt></ruby><br>Pour tea for the guests.<br><ruby>妈妈 在给孩子 们做饭。<rt>Māma zài gěi háizi men zuòfàn.</rt></ruby><br>Mom cooks for the kids.<br><ruby>我 儿子 喜欢给小狗洗澡。<rt>Wǒ érzi xǐhuan gěi xiǎogǒu xǐzǎo.</rt></ruby><br>My son likes giving our dog a bath.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLHAV3		{}
为 + Person + Predicate<br>为人民 服务 ！		- Expressing 'for' with 'wei'<br>- When you workfora company or do other sorts of physical (and even mental) activities for another party, you're likely to use the Chinese preposition 为 (wèi). This character is often translated into English as 'for,' but is sometimes unnatural or unnecessary, depending on the particular phrase.  For example, the super common Mao-era phrase, 为人民服务 (wèi rénmín fúwù), 'serve the people,' doesn't need the word 'for' in English.<br>- Don't confuse this preposition with为了, which is a bit different.<br>- 为 + Party + Verb / Adj.<br><ruby>我们 都为你高兴。<rt>Wǒmen dōu wèi nǐ gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>We are all happy for you.<br><ruby>谁为我考虑过 ？<rt>Shéi wèi wǒ kǎolǜ guo?</rt></ruby><br>Who has ever considered me?<br><ruby>你们 可以 来为我们加油。<rt>Nǐmen kěyǐ lái wèi wǒmen jiāyóu.</rt></ruby><br>You guys can come to cheer us on.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG68RBX		{}
不到 + Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>我 女儿不到三 岁 。		- Expressing 'less than' with 'budao'<br>- The word 到 (dào) means 'arrive,' but it can also mean 'to reach' or 'to get to' in an abstract sense. So in this pattern, 不到 (bùdào) means 'to not reach (the amount of),' or, to put it another way, 'to be less than.'<br>- Subj. + 不到 + Number + [Measure Word] + Noun<br><ruby>我 女儿不到三 岁 。<rt>Wǒ nǚ'ér bùdào sān suì.</rt></ruby><br>My daughter is not yet three years old.<br><ruby>我 昨天 睡 了不到五 个 小时 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān shuì le bùdào wǔ gè xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br> Yesterday I slept for almost five hours.<br><ruby>这 件 衣服 花 了不到一 百 块 。<rt>Zhè jiàn yīfu huā le bùdào yī bǎi kuài.</rt></ruby><br>On this piece of clothing I spent less than 100 RMB.<br><hr><br>- When 不到 (bùdào) is put before a time or a duration of time, it needs to be followed with 就 (jiù).

向 + Direction / Person + Verb<br>你 必须向他 道歉！		- Expressing 'towards' with 'xiang'<br>- 向 (xiàng) is a preposition that means 'towards' and is used often with certain verbs. These usages need to be learned together with 向.<br>- When used as a preposition, 向 indicates an action that is performed towards a reference point but doesn't have any actual motion towards that point.<br>- 向 + Direction / Person + Verb<br><ruby>向东 走 。<rt>Xiàng dōng zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>Walk to the east.<br><ruby>向前 看 。<rt>Xiàng qián kàn.</rt></ruby><br>Look forward.<br><ruby>向左 转 。<rt>Xiàng zuǒ zhuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Turn to the left.<br><hr><br>- Whereas in English we would say 'learn from someone,' in Chinese this would be expressed as 'learn toward someone,' as in the following example (and famous propaganda slogan):<br><ruby>向雷锋 同志 学习 ！<rt>Xiàng Léi Fēng tóngzhì xuéxí!</rt></ruby><br>Learn from Comrade Lei Feng!<br><hr><br>- More examples:<br><ruby>我 不 喜欢向朋友 借钱 。<rt>Wǒ bù xǐhuan xiàng péngyou jiè qián.</rt></ruby><br>I don't like to borrow money from friends.<br><ruby>你 会向陌生人 求助 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ huì xiàng mòshēngrén qiúzhù ma?</rt></ruby><br>Would you ask strangers for help?<br><ruby>我们 都 没 经验 ，是 来向你 请教 的 。<rt>Wǒmen dōu méi jīngyàn, shì lái xiàng nǐ qǐngjiào de.</rt></ruby><br>None of us has experience.

往 + Direction Word<br>往 + Direction / Place + Verb		- Expressing 'toward' with 'wang'<br>- Although 往 (wǎng) simply means 'towards,' it's not used as often as certain otherprepositionsand also has a few special use cases, so it warrants a little extra attention.<br>- 往 (wǎng) is a preposition that means 'towards' and precedes theverbit modifies.<br>- This is the common one used in everyday speech.<br>- Adding 往 (wǎng) with a location or place word indicates the direction of an action. Remember that the verb comesafterthis 往 phrase.<br>- 往 + Direction / Place + Verb<br><ruby>一直往前走。<rt>Yīzhí wǎng qián zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>Go straight ahead.<br><ruby>往左拐。<rt>Wǎng zuǒ guǎi.</rt></ruby><br>Turn left.<br><ruby>往上看。<rt>Wǎng shàng kàn.</rt></ruby><br>Look up there.<br><hr><br>- In written language,  往 (wǎng) can also be usedaftera few monosyllabic verbs, which are then followed bylocation nouns.<br>- Verb + 往 + Direction / Place<br><ruby>开往北京 的 火车<rt>kāi wǎng Běijīng de huǒchē</rt></ruby><br>the train that goes to Beijing<br><ruby>飞往纽约 的 飞机<rt>fēi wǎng Niǔyuē de fēijī</rt></ruby><br>the airplane that flies to New York<br><ruby>运往国外 的 货物<rt>yùn wǎng guówài de huòwù</rt></ruby><br>cargo that is shipped overseas<br><hr><br>- 往下 (wǎng xià) expresses 'keep going,' implying that the process has been interrupted before.

在 + Topic + 上 ，Subj. ⋯⋯<br>在美国 历史上，最重要 的 总统 是 谁 ？		- Idiomatic phrases with 'zai'<br>- You probably already know how toexpress location with 在. In this article, we'll go more in depth as to how you can make idiomatic phrases using that construction. This kind of form is actually similar to some that we have in English, so it won't be too difficult.<br>- This construction can be translated as 'on the topic of' or 'in regards to.' It can be used to comment on an idea or concept. The examples below will help.<br>- 在 + Topic + 上 ，Subj. ⋯⋯<br>- Note that the subject can also be put before 在.<br><ruby>在这 个 问题上，我们 的 看法 是 一样 的 。<rt>Zài zhège wèntí shàng, wǒmen de kànfǎ shì yīyàng de.</rt></ruby><br>In regards to this problem, our opinions are the same.<br><ruby>在美国 历史上，谁 是 最 重要 的 总统 ？<rt>Zài Měiguó lìshǐ shàng, shéi shì zuì zhòngyào de zǒngtǒng ?</rt></ruby><br>In regards to American history, who is the most important president?<br><ruby>这个 句子在语法上没 什么 问题 ，但是 不 太 自然 。<rt>Zhège jùzi zài yǔfǎ shàng méi shénme wèntí, dànshì bù tài zìrán.</rt></ruby><br>This sentence is okay to say in terms of grammar, it's just not very natural.<br><hr><br>- This construction can be translated (rather directly) as 'under' and expresses conditions that affected the comment that comes after.<br>- 在 ⋯⋯ 下 ，⋯⋯<br><ruby>在这样 的 环境下长大 ，孩子 会 快乐 吗 ？<rt>Zài zhèyàng de huánjìng xià zhǎngdà, háizi huì kuàilè ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you think kids will be happy growing up in this kind of environment?<br><ruby>在这 种 情况下，你们 会 怎么 做 ？<rt>Zài zhè zhǒng qíngkuàng xià, nǐmen huì zěnme zuò?</rt></ruby><br>Under these kinds of circumstances, what would you do?<br><ruby>在紧急 情况下，你 可以 这样 做 。<rt>Zài jǐnjí qíngkuàng xià, nǐ kěyǐ zhèyàng zuò.</rt></ruby><br>In an emergency situation, you can do this.<br><hr><br>- This construction is similar to the 在⋯⋯上 above, which translates to 'in relation to' or 'on the topic of.'<br>- 在 + Topic + 方面 ，Subj. ⋯⋯<br><ruby>在事业方面，我 老板 很 成功 。<rt>Zài shìyè fāngmiàn, wǒ lǎobǎn hěn chénggōng.</rt></ruby><br>With regards to career, my boss is very successful.<br><ruby>在技术方面，他 是 专家 。<rt>Zài jìshù fāngmiàn, tā shì zhuānjiā.</rt></ruby><br>When it comes to technology, he's an expert.<br><ruby>在管理方面，你 比 我 有经验 。<rt>Zài guǎnlǐ fāngmiàn, nǐ bǐ wǒ yǒu jīngyàn.</rt></ruby><br>When it comes to management, you have more experience than I do.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGH13JY		{}
Subj. + 对 + Person + Verb<br>宝宝对我 笑 了。		- Using 'dui' with verbs<br>- When using 对 (duì) as apreposition, it means 'to' or 'towards' an object or target. As with all prepositions, you've got to watch out when using this word, as usage of 对 in Chinese doesn't always totally 'make sense' or correspond to English at all.<br>- Subj. + 对 + Person + Verb<br>- Note that you shouldn't be plugging in just any old verb here; the ones that work with 对 are limited.<br><ruby>宝宝对我笑 了 。<rt>Bǎobao duì wǒ xiào le.</rt></ruby><br>The baby smiled at me.<br><ruby>小狗 在对你叫 。<rt>Xiǎogǒu zài duì nǐ jiào.</rt></ruby><br>The dog is barking at you.<br><ruby>你 不 应该 这样对父母说话 。<rt>Nǐ bù yīnggāi zhèyàng duì fùmǔ shuōhuà.</rt></ruby><br>You shouldn't talk to your parents this way.<br><hr><br>- In English we often start sentences with 'to someone' or 'for someone' when sharing that person's perspective. In Chinese, the pattern is:<br>- 对 + Person + 来说 ，⋯⋯<br>- While this pattern was too common to omit from this page, it's covered in more depth as part ofphrases using 'laishuo.'<br>- Certain verbs, especiallypsychological verbs, are often used with 对, which means 对 is needed if you want to add an object into the structure. I good example is 对……感兴趣 ('to be interested in...'). In this case, 对 means 'in,' 'on,' 'about,' etc., and the object doesn't have to be a person. The short list below will give a few more verbs frequently paired with 对.<br>- Some example sentences:<br><ruby>我 儿子对学 外语 很感 兴趣。<rt>Wǒ érzi duì xué wàiyǔ hěn gǎn xìngqù.</rt></ruby><br>My son is very interested in learning foreign languages.<br><ruby>你 应该对自己 的 工作负责。<rt>Nǐ yīnggāi duì zìjǐ de gōngzuò fùzé .</rt></ruby><br>You should be responsible for your job.<br><ruby>老板对你 不 太满意。<rt>Lǎobǎn duì nǐ bù tài mǎnyì.</rt></ruby><br>The boss is not very satisfied with you.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8ICO9		{}
看起来⋯⋯<br>这 家 餐厅看起来不错 。		- Appearance with 'kanqilai'<br>- One of the most common ways to express how something 'looks' is to use 看起来 (kànqilai). This is what we would use if we wanted to express something like 'he looks tired.'<br>- This pattern is most commonly followed by an adjectival phrase. This can include regularadverbsof degree like很, or negative adverbs like不.<br>- Subj. + 看起来 + Adj.<br><ruby>蛋糕看起来很 好吃 。<rt>Dàngāo kànqilai hěn hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>The cake looks really tasty.<br><ruby>这 家 餐厅看起来不错。<rt>Zhè jiā cāntīng kànqilai bùcuò.</rt></ruby><br>This restaurant looks good.<br><ruby>你 男朋友看起来很 成熟 。<rt>Nǐ nánpéngyou kànqilai hěn chéngshú.</rt></ruby><br>Your boyfriend looks very mature.<br><hr><br>- If you want to statewhatsomething lookslike, you'll also need to follow 看起来 with 像 (xiàng), and then the noun phrase.<br>- Subj. + 看起来 + 像 + Noun Phrase<br><ruby>你 妈妈 真 年轻 ！看起来像你 姐姐 。<rt>Nǐ māma zhēn niánqīng!

Subj. + 让 / 叫 / 请 / 使 + Person + Predicate<br>你 为什么 不让我 去 ？		- Causative verbs<br>- Causative verbs are used to cause or influence people to do things. In English, these are verbs like 'make,' 'let,' 'have,' and 'get,' when used in a sentence like 'get Billy to eat a live worm.'<br>- The most common causative verbs in Chinese are:<br>- Subj. + [Causative Verb] + Person + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br>- 使 (shǐ) and 让 (ràng), when used as causative verbs, basically mean the same thing ('to make'), but 使 (shǐ) is used in more formal or written Chinese, while 让 (ràng) is used more in spoken Chinese.<br>- It's worth noting that 让 is the most common causative verb in spoken Mandarin and is often translated into English as either 'make' or 'let.' It may seem strange to speakers of English that these two very different words are the same word in Chinese. 'Make' is kind of like forcing, and 'let' is kind of like allowing, right? But in Chinese, the context generally makes clear how willing the object of the causative verb is. It's just something that takes time for learners to get used to.<br><ruby>你 为什么 不让我 去 ？<rt>Nǐ wèishénme bù ràng wǒ qù?</rt></ruby><br>Why won't you let me go?<br><ruby>这 部 电影让人 很 感动 。<rt>Zhè bù diànyǐng ràng rén hěn gǎndòng.</rt></ruby><br>This movie really moves people.<br><ruby>那个 老人让我 想到 了 我 爷爷 。<rt>Nàge lǎorén ràng wǒ xiǎng dào le wǒ yéye.</rt></ruby><br>That old man made me think of my grandpa.<br><hr><br>- Obviously, not every causative verb maps perfectly to an English causative verb. You can see from these examples than in some cases the natural English translation doesn't even need a causative verb.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5T7XC		{}
这 / 那 + 要看 / 得看 + Unclear Situation<br>这得 看你 的 时间 。		- Expressing 'it depends' with 'kan'<br>- Although there are a number of ways to express 'it depends' in Chinese, the most common ones in informal spoken Chinese involve the verb 看 (kàn). Some common expressions include 要看 (yào kàn) and 得看 (děi kàn). Both mean '(it) depends (on).' Literally, they would translate as 'have to look at,' so the logic is not hard to understand.<br>- If you're answering a question with 'it depends on...' then this is the pattern you want.<br>- 这 / 那 + 要看 / 得看 + [Unclear Situation]<br>- Keep in mind that the 'answers' below are meant to be an answer to some imaginary question that we don't include.<br><ruby>这得 看你 的 时间 。<rt>Zhè děi kàn nǐ de shíjiān.</rt></ruby><br>This depends on when you are available.<br><ruby>那要 看他 愿 不 愿意 。<rt>Nà yào kàn tā yuàn bu yuànyì.</rt></ruby><br>That depends on whether he is willing or not.<br><ruby>这得 看天气 怎么样 。<rt>Zhè děi kàn tiānqì zěnmeyàng.</rt></ruby><br>It depends on how the weather is.<br><hr><br>- If you're going to write a full sentence explaining what 'it' depends on, then you're going to need to lead off with some kind of explanation of the 'unknown outcome' of what 'it depends' on. So you'll start with the 'unknown outcome' in the first part of the sentence (before要看 / 得看) and then end up with what 'it depends on' (after要看 / 得看).<br>- [Unknown Outcome] + 要看 / 得看 + [Unclear Situation]<br>- The 'unknown outcome' normally includes some kind ofquestion word, meaning something like 'whether or notx happens' or 'whatx does,' etc.<br><ruby>去不去得 看我 的 心情 。<rt>Qù bu qù děi kàn wǒ de xīnqíng.</rt></ruby><br>Whether or not I go depends on my mood.<br><ruby>什么时候去要 看公司 的 安排 。<rt>Shénme shíhou qù yào kàn gōngsī de ānpái.</rt></ruby><br>When we go depends on the company's arrangements.<br><ruby>学 音乐还是学 画画要 看孩子 的 兴趣 。<rt>Xué yīnyuè háishì xué huàhuà yào kàn háizi de xìngqù.</rt></ruby><br>Whether to study music or drawing depends on your child's interest.<br><hr><br>- If you're looking for more formal language, consider 取决于 (qǔjué yú), 'to be determined by.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG765HD		{}
好像⋯⋯<br>他好像是 英国 人 。		- Expressing 'it seems' with 'haoxiang'<br>- To express 'seems,' the word 好像 (hǎoxiàng) can be used.<br>- Subj. + 好像 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>他好像是 英国 人 。<rt>Tā hǎoxiàng shì Yīngguó rén.</rt></ruby><br>He seems to be British.<br><ruby>你好像不 是 本地 人 。<rt>Nǐ hǎoxiàng bù shì běndìrén.</rt></ruby><br>You don't seem to be a local.<br><ruby>她好像生病 了 。<rt>Tā hǎoxiàng shēngbìng le.</rt></ruby><br>It seems like she's sick.<br><hr><br>- Note that if this structure is used without a subject, it has the meaning of 'it seems like...' or 'it seems that...' in English. This could then be followed by an entire statement.<br><ruby>好像不 行 。<rt>Hǎoxiàng bù xíng.</rt></ruby><br>It seems like it didn't work.<br><ruby>好像要 下雨 了 。<rt>Hǎoxiàng yào xiàyǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>It seems like it's going to rain.<br><ruby>好像有 人 敲门 。<rt>Hǎoxiàng yǒu rén qiāo mén.</rt></ruby><br>It seems that someone is knocking at the door.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG3ROPY		{}
Subj. + 以为⋯⋯<br>我以为你 不 是 我的 朋友。		- Expressing 'mistakenly think that' with 'yiwei'<br>- When we talk about mistaken beliefs in English, we just use the word 'thought,' and the context and the rest of the sentence makes clear that we were wrong. In Chinese, there's a specificverbjust for 'think mistakenly': 以为 (yǐwéi).<br>- In English, the verb 'to think' can apply to both correct and incorrect notions. Chinese has a specific verb for 'to mistakenly think that': 以为 (yǐwéi). Literally, these two characters mean, 'take to be,' i.e. someone takes one thing to be something else.<br>- Subj. + 以为 ⋯⋯<br>- The part that follows 以为 will be a whole phrase that is actually incorrect information. Note that while it's quite common to refer to things that happened in the past, it could also refer to a situation in the present or even the future. It can also be used for commands, usually of the negative 'don't think that...' type.<br><ruby>我以为他 是 德国 人 。<rt>Wǒ yǐwéi tā shì Déguó rén.</rt></ruby><br>I thought he was German.<br><ruby>我们以为你 不 在 家 。<rt>Wǒmen yǐwéi nǐ bù zài jiā .</rt></ruby><br>We thought you weren't at home.<br><ruby>你以为你 是 谁 ？<rt>Nǐ yǐwéi nǐ shì shéi?</rt></ruby><br>Who do you think you are?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGRBC43		{}

通过 + Agent / Method ，⋯⋯<br>我们 是通过他 的 朋友 找到 他 的 。		- Expressing 'through' with 'tongguo'<br>- The first meaning of 通过 (tōngguò) used as a verb is 'to go through' a certain object, as in penetrating into and coming out of something.

Subj. + 算 + Adj. + 的<br>在 我们 公司 ，我算年轻 的 。		- Making judgments with 'suan'<br>- The word 算 (suàn) has a number of uses which can be translated in a number of ways. The common theme is that 算 indicates some kind of judgment and may be thought of as 'counts as' or 'is considered to be.'<br>- This essentially expresses that one 'considers' something to be something else, as in, 'I consider her a genius.'<br>- Subj. (+ 不) + 算 + Noun<br><ruby>她算天才 。<rt>Tā suàn tiāncái.</rt></ruby><br>She is considered a genius.<br><ruby>这算秘密 吗 ？<rt>Zhè suàn mìmì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is this considered a secret?<br><ruby>她算不算你 女朋友 ？<rt>Tā suàn bu suàn nǐ nǚpéngyou?</rt></ruby><br>Can she be considered your girlfriend or not?<br><hr><br>- 算 can also be used with an adjective.

He can't be considered very tall.<br><hr><br>- For both the noun and adjective patterns above, the 'judgment' indicated by 算 can be made more reluctant by following 算 immediately with a 是.<br><hr><br>- A few common examples:<br><ruby>算你 狠！<rt>Suàn nǐ hěn!</rt></ruby><br>Well aren't you tough!<br><ruby>你算老几 ？<rt>Nǐ suàn lǎojǐ?</rt></ruby><br>So you think you're some kind of big shot?<br><ruby>这不 算什么 。<rt>Zhè bù suàn shénme.</rt></ruby><br>It's no big deal.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGWDWFN		{}
(让 +) Subj. + 来<br>让 我来吧。		- Using 'lai' as a dummy verb<br>- The verb 来 (lái) can be used as a 'dummy verb,' similar to the way 'do' is used in English. To illustrate the point, imagine a bottle of pickles that you want to open but can't because the lid is so tight. You start passing it around to see who can open it, and no one is able to, until your beefy friend comes in and says, '我来!' He is saying, 'Let me do it!'<br>- The structure for using 来 as a dummy verb is very basic. Usually it is a very short phrase, kind of like 'your turn!' or 'let me give it a shot!' or 'you do it!' in English. Usually it is used with 你 or 我 as the subject, and it ends with the 来. Sometimes it can end with a 吧.<br>- (让 +) Subj. + 来<br>- The point of calling 来 a 'dummy verb' is that it does't have the original meaning of 'to come.'

Subj. + 不用 + Verb Phrase<br>不用担心 。		- Expressing 'don't need to' with 'buyong'<br>- In Chinese,要 (yào) has many meanings, one of which is 'need to.' However, when you want to express 'don't need to,' you actually use 不用 (bùyòng), not 不要 (bùyào).<br>- Subj. + 不用 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>不用谢 。<rt>Bùyòng xiè.</rt></ruby><br>You don't need to thank me.<br><ruby>不用担心 。<rt>Bùyòng dānxīn.</rt></ruby><br>You don't need to worry.<br><ruby>孩子不用买 票 。<rt>Háizi bùyòng mǎi piào.</rt></ruby><br>Kids don't need to buy tickets.<br><hr><br>- In spoken Chinese, the rhetorical question, '这还用说吗？' indicates the speaker believes that the statement is obvious. It is equivalent to the speaker saying, 'does that even need to be said?' or 'is that seriously a question?' This 用 is the direct opposite of the 不用 in this grammar point, but you don't hear it a lot.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGECD0E		{}
得 + Verb<br>我们得走 了 。		- Expressing 'must' with 'dei'<br>- The auxiliary verb 得 (děi) means 'must.' Yes, it's annoying that the same character can also be pronounced 'de,' but at least when you use 得 (děi), there's noambiguity like with the word 要 (yào).<br>- Normally, when you see 得, it's a particle and is pronounced 'de.' However, it can also be anauxiliary verb. In this case it's pronounced 'děi' and means 'must.'<br>- Subj. + 得 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>我们得走 了 。<rt>Wǒmen děi zǒu le.</rt></ruby><br>We have to leave now.<br><ruby>时间 不 早 了，我得回家 了。<rt>Shíjiān bù zǎo le, wǒ děi huíjiā le.</rt></ruby><br>It's getting late. I have to go home.<br><ruby>他 是 你 弟弟 ，你得帮 他 。<rt>Tā shì nǐ dìdi, nǐ děi bāng tā.</rt></ruby><br>He is your younger brother. You must help him.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPXLP9		{}
少 + Verb<br>请少放 点 盐 。		- Doing something less with 'shao'<br>- The word 少 (shǎo) can mean 'few,' but when placed before a verb, it takes on the meaning of 'less' as in 'to do less (of something).' It is often heard when scolding or giving advice (like when parents talk to children). What's not intuitive to learners is that the word 少 should comebefore the verb.<br>- Just as you can use 多 to talk aboutdoing something more, you can use 少 to talk about doing somethingless.<br>- 少 + Verb<br>- Note that in English, we don't use the word 'less' very much.  For example, rather than saying 'drink less water,' we might say 'don't drink so much water.'  In Chinese, though, using 少 is quite natural and common.  Avoiding the negative command (telling someonenotto do something) is also a subtle way of sounding less bossy and annoying in Chinese.<br><ruby>请少放 点 盐 。<rt>Qǐng shǎo fàng diǎn yán.</rt></ruby><br>Use less salt, please.<br><ruby>少吃 垃圾 食品 。<rt>Shǎo chī lājī shípǐn.</rt></ruby><br>Eat less junk food.<br><ruby>少买 点 ，吃 不 完 会 坏 的 。<rt>Shǎo mǎi diǎn, chī bu wán huì huài de.</rt></ruby><br>Don't buy too much. It will go bad if we can't finish eating it all.<br><hr><br>- These set phrases are worth special note, because although they follow the grammar pattern, they might not make sense to you without a little extra explanation, just like the meaning of 'come on' might not make sense at first to someone learning English.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9B0M8		{}
多 + Verb<br>多吃 点 。		- Doing something more with 'duo'<br>- In China, you often hear you should do this or that more (eat more, drink more water, wear more warm clothing, etc.), and they often use the word 多 (duō). What's not intuitive to learners is that the word 多 should comebefore the verb.<br>- This structure is often used in commands or suggestions.  Note the position of 多:<br>- 多 + Verb<br>- This structure is not used exclusively as a command, so you could also include a subject if you needed to.<br>- In English we like to say things like 'eatmore,' 'drinkmorebeer,' and 'I need to exercisemore.'  Notice that in every one of these cases, the word 'more' (equivalent to this use of 多) comesafterthe verb in English.  In Chinese, it's more natural to put the 多beforethe verb.<br><ruby>多吃 点 。<rt>Duō chī diǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Eat a little more.<br><ruby>多放 点 辣 。<rt>Duō fàng diǎn là.</rt></ruby><br>Add a little more spiciness.<br><ruby>多拿 一点 。<rt>Duō ná yīdiǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Take more.<br><hr><br>- Just to be completely clear, the following uses of 多 are not as natural as the ones above.  They'll be understood, and they might not be technicallywrong, but you can do better!<br><hr><br>- The opposite of 多 is, of course, 少.  It is further explained in the articledoing something less with 'shao'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLKGZP		{}
正在 + Verb + 着 + 呢<br>我正在吃饭呢。		- Expressing actions in progress (full form)<br>- You may have learned that在 (zài)and正在 (zhèngzài)can be used beforeverbsto express that an action isongoingorin progress. They are used to create the Mandarin equivalent ofpresent continuousin English. But that pattern is actually a part of a longer, fuller pattern.  It's rarely used in its full form, but bits and pieces of it are frequently used in everyday speech, so it's important to know the full form, even if you don't use it regularly yourself.<br>- Subj. + 正在 / 正 / 在 + Verb + 呢<br>- If it's aSeparable verb, you need to put the 着 between the verb and the object, or you can just leave 着 out.<br>- Subj. (+ 正) + Verb + 着 + Obj. + 呢<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. + 呢<br>- It's important to remember thatvirtually every part of the above pattern isoptional, so you're going to see all sorts of variations of it (and rarely the full form).  The most common variation is just the '在 + V' pattern that you probably already learned long ago. Another common variation is '正 + V' pattern.<br><ruby>我正在吃饭 。<rt>Wǒ zhèngzài chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>我正吃着饭呢。<rt>Wǒ zhèng chī zhe fàn ne.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>我 吃 饭呢。<rt>Wǒ chīfàn ne.</rt></ruby><br>I'm eating now.<br><hr><br><ruby>爷爷正在看 报纸 ，别 打扰 他 。<rt>Yéye zhèngzài kàn bàozhǐ, bié dǎrǎo tā.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>爷爷在看 报纸呢，别 打扰 他 。<rt>Yéye zài kàn bàozhǐ ne, bié dǎrǎo tā.</rt></ruby><br><br><ruby>爷爷 看 报纸呢，别 打扰 他 。<rt>Yéye kàn bàozhǐ ne, bié dǎrǎo tā.</rt></ruby><br>Grandpa is reading newspapers now.

不怎么 + Verb<br>我 儿子不怎么吃 零食 。		- Expressing 'not often' with 'bu zenme'<br>- You might be tempted to conclude that 不怎么 (bù zěnme) seems to mean 'not how,' but it actually means 'not often' when used together with a verb.<br>- When 不怎么 is used with a verb, it means that one does not put a lot of time or energy into doing it. In other words, the action is done 'not often.' When the verb is used with an object, it also means that the number (or quantity) is really small.<br>- Subj. + 不怎么 + Verb<br><ruby>他不怎么爱 说话 。<rt>Tā bù zěnme ài shuōhuà.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't like to talk much.<br><ruby>我 老公不怎么运动 。<rt>Wǒ lǎogōng bù zěnme yùndòng.</rt></ruby><br>My husband doesn't exercise much.<br><ruby>我们 在家不怎么看 电视 。<rt>Wǒmen zài jiā bù zěnme kàn diànshì.</rt></ruby><br>We don't watch a lot of television at home.<br><hr><br>- Note that the examples below use 没 instead of 不. This is because the verb uses or implies 有 and  thus it uses the samethe 有 negation rules.<br><ruby>我没 怎么复习 。<rt>Wǒ méi zěnme fùxí.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't review much.<br><ruby>我没 怎么想 过 这个 问题 。<rt>Wǒ méi zěnme xiǎng guo zhège wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't really think about this before.<br><ruby>昨天 我 肚子 不 舒服 ，没 怎么吃 东西 。<rt>Zuótiān wǒ dùzi bù shūfu, méi zěnme chī dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>My stomach didn't feel well yesterday, so I didn't eat much.<br><hr><br>- Lastly, make sure to use 不怎么 with a verb if you want it to mean 'not often.' Using it with an adjective gives it adifferent meaning.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5BOGP		{}
Verb + 到 + Time / Event<br>我 昨天 晚上 工作到十二 点 半 。		- Expressing 'until' with 'dao'<br>- One kind ofcomplementin Chinese involves putting 到 (dào) after the verb, followed by a time or other event. This 到 works much like the English word 'until.'<br>- (一直 +) Verb + 到 + Time / Event<br>- You will sometimes see 一直 (yīzhí) proceeding 到, which serves the purpose of the emphasis on the 'ongoing duration.'<br>- Note that the verbs are mostly single-syllable.<br><ruby>你们 要 玩到几 点 ？<rt>Nǐmen yào wán dào jǐ diǎn?</rt></ruby><br>When will you be done playing?<br><ruby>我们 在 酒吧一直聊到半夜 。<rt>Wǒmen zài jiǔbā yīzhí liáo dào bànyè.</rt></ruby><br>We were chatting in the bar until midnight.<br><ruby>你 弟弟 要 在 我们 家 住到什么 时候 ？<rt>Nǐ dìdi yào zài wǒmen jiā zhù dào shénme shíhou?</rt></ruby><br>Your younger brother is going to stay in our house until when?<br><hr><br>- If there is a verb phrase proceeding 到, use this structure:<br>- [Verb Phrase] (+ 一直) + Verb + 到 + Time / Event<br>- Note that in this pattern, the verb is going to repeat.<br><ruby>你 知 不 知道 我们等 你等到半夜 ？<rt>Nǐ zhī bu zhīdào wǒmen děng nǐ děng dào bànyè?</rt></ruby><br>Do you know we waited for you until midnight?<br><ruby>我 女儿 昨天 晚上写作业写到十二 点 半 。<rt>Wǒ nǚ'ér zuótiān wǎnshang xiě zuòyè xiě dào shí'èr diǎn bàn.</rt></ruby><br>My daughter didn't finish her homework until 12:30 last night.<br><ruby>她 给 男朋友打电话打到手机 没 电 。<rt>Tā gěi nánpéngyou dǎ diànhuà dǎ dào shǒujī méi diàn.</rt></ruby><br>She called her boyfriend and they kept talking until her phone was out of battery.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1CCAP		{}
Verb + Number + Measure Word<br>做三次。读两遍 。		- Measure words for verbs<br>- When a verb is done more than once, it also requires a measure word to accompany it. This way the measure word is acting as a way to count the frequency or re-occurrence of an action. The most basic one you probably already know is 次 (cì).<br>- Verb + Number + Measure Word<br>- The grammar pattern is very similar to English. For example, '看三次' and 'saw three times' mirror each other in structure. In Chinese sentences, these measure words come after the verb. You should also know that, like nouns, some verbs have special measure words to go with them. The basic verbal measure word, however, is 次, as in the number of 'times' something is done or happens.<br>- Common verb measure words include 次 (cì), 遍 (biàn), and 下 (xià).<br><ruby>再 说 一遍。<rt>Zài shuō yī biàn.</rt></ruby><br>Say it again.<br><ruby>你 能 再 读 一遍吗 ？<rt>Nǐ néng zài dú yī biàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Could you please read it again?<br><ruby>这个 电影 我 看 过 两遍。<rt>Zhège diànyǐng wǒ kàn guo liǎng biàn.</rt></ruby><br>I've seen this movie twice.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5AODR		{}
Verb-Obj.<br>我们见过面。		- Separable verb<br>- 'Separable verbs' get their name from their ability to 'separate' into two parts (averbpart and anobjectpart), with other words in between. In fact, you could also simply call separable verbs 'verb-objectphrases.'<br>- Separable verbs are 'verb-objectphrases.' They consist of two characters: the first is the verb, and the second is the object. Very often, these two will appear together, seemingly acting as a single verb, as in 吃饭, 'to eat,' 见面, 'to meet,' or 睡觉, 'to sleep.' But the two can also separate, and the verb can also be used without the object.<br>- Verb + Object<br>- Verb... [Other Stuff]... Object<br>- Let's look at a typical example in Chinese, using the verb 见面, meaning 'to meet.' 见 is the verb; 面 is the object, which literally means 'face,' but is never translated as such. The mistake everyone makes is to put an object after 见面. You can't do this, though, because 见面already has its own object.<br>- The key features of separable verbs are:<br>- The key to using separable verbs correctly is to remember that they are 'Verb + Object' constructs.The verb alone must be treated as a verb, and the object cannot be treated as part of the verb.<br>- The first step in mastering separable verbs is knowingwhich verbs are actually separable verbs.<br>- Some of the more common separable verbs you should already know include: 吃饭 (chīfàn), 出差 (chūchāi), 读书 (dúshū), 过年 (guònián), 见面 (jiànmiàn), 讲话 (jiǎnghuà), 开车 (kāichē), 开会 (kāihuì), 看病 (kànbìng), 聊天 (liáotiān), 生气 (shēngqì), 谈话 (tánhuà), 洗澡 (xǐzǎo), 游泳 (yóuyǒng).<br>- Slightly less common (but still useful for intermediate learners) separable verbs include: 帮忙 (bāngmáng), 分手 (fēnshǒu), 结婚 (jiéhūn), 请假 (qǐngjià), 离婚 (líhūn), 跑步 (pǎobù), 报名 (bàomíng), 道歉 (dàoqiàn), 散步 (sànbù), 排队 (páiduì).<br>- Perhaps the most common examples of separable verbs that beginners first struggle with are 见面 and 睡觉. What makes them especially hard is that the 'object' part of each word seem to have no counterpart in English. 'Meet face?' 'Sleep a sleep?' It all feels very odd.<br>- Below we will introduce separable verbs in more detail, provide more examples, and also offer more specific cases which can trip up learners.<br>- A few verbs allow you to effectively add an additional object by using a 跟 (or 和) phrase before the verb.<br>- 跟 + Person + Verb + Object<br>- In this pattern, the verb-object construct remains unseparated.<br><ruby>我 明天跟他见面。<rt>Wǒ míngtiān gēn tā jiànmiàn.</rt></ruby><br>I'll meet him tomorrow.<br><ruby>我 不要跟她结婚。<rt>Wǒ bùyào gēn tā jiéhūn.</rt></ruby><br>I don't want to marry her.<br><ruby>你 还 没有跟我道歉。<rt>Nǐ hái méiyǒu 跟 wǒ dàoqiàn.</rt></ruby><br>You still haven't apologized to me.<br><hr><br>- You'll have to learn which separable verbs allow this pattern on a case-by-case basis.<br>- Hint: they go after the verb,notthe object.<br>- Verb + 了 / 过 / 着 + Object<br>- 见面  (jiànmiàn)<br>- 开会 (kāihuì)<br><ruby>我们 早上开了会。<rt>Wǒmen zǎoshang kāi le huì.</rt></ruby><br>We had a meeting in the morning.<br><ruby>你们开过会了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen kāi guo huì le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have you had the meeting yet?<br><ruby>我们 正开着会呢 。<rt>Wǒmen zhèng kāi zhe huì ne.</rt></ruby><br>We're having a meeting right now.<br><hr><br>- 吃饭 (chīfàn)<br><ruby>他 昨天 来 我 家 了 ，还吃了饭。<rt>Tā zuótiān lái wǒ jiā le, hái chī le fàn.</rt></ruby><br>He came to my house yesterday and he ate a meal with us.<br><ruby>他吃过饭了 吗 ？<rt>Tā chī guo fàn le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Has he eaten yet?<br><ruby>他 正吃着饭呢 。<rt>Tā zhèng chī zhe fàn ne.</rt></ruby><br>He's eating a meal right now.<br><hr><br>- Note: unlike the particles 过 and 着, the particle 了 is especially tricky, andit can also appear after the object. So it can be correct in multiple places.<br>- You guessed it: they go after the verb,notthe object.<br>- Verb + [Measure Word Phrase] + Object<br>- 见面 (jiànmiàn)<br><ruby>我们见个面吧 。<rt>Wǒmen jiàn gè miàn ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's meet.<br><ruby>我们见过几 次面。<rt>Wǒmen jiàn guo jǐ cì miàn.</rt></ruby><br>We've met a few times.<br><hr><br>- 吃饭 (chīfàn)<br><ruby>我们 一起吃过几 次饭。<rt>Wǒmen yīqǐ chī guo jǐ cì fàn.</rt></ruby><br>We've had several meals together.<br><ruby>老板 请 大家吃了一 顿饭。<rt>Lǎobǎn qǐng dàjiā chī le yī dùn fàn.</rt></ruby><br>The boss treated everyone to dinner.<br><hr><br>- 睡觉 (shuìjiào)<br><ruby>晚安！睡个好 觉。<rt>Wǎn'ān! Shuì gè hǎo jiào.</rt></ruby><br>Good night! I hope you have a good sleep.<br><ruby>昨晚 我 只睡了两 个 小时觉。<rt>Zuówǎn wǒ zhǐ shuì le liǎng gè xiǎoshí jiào.</rt></ruby><br>I only slept two hours last night.<br><hr><br>- Reduplicationis a way to express the casual nature of a verb or that it happens only briefly. When it comes to separable verbs,only the verb part reduplicates.<br>- Verb + Verb + Object<br>- Note that you can't put 一下 after separable verbs to express that it happened briefly.<br><hr><br>- 帮忙 (bāngmáng) to help; to do a favor.帮 is the verb; 忙 is the object, meaning 'a favor.'<br><hr><br>- If you want to ask someone to do you a favor, check this out:<br>- 结婚 (jiéhūn) to get married.结 is the verb; 婚 acts as the object, meaning 'marriage.' However, 婚 cannot typically be used as a noun by itself.<br>- 聊天 (liáotiān) to chat; to talk (about things in general).聊 is the verb; 天 acts as the object.<br>- Literally, 天 doesn't mean anything. The object needs to be something specific if you want to make the topic  clear.<br>- If separable verbs are simply verb-object phrases, then why the special name? It's because there are some special features of Chinese verb-object phrases worth special attention, and the name 'separable verbs' helps call attention to this. Mastering separable verbs can be a little tricky and is an essential objective of the intermediate (B1) level learner of Chinese.<br>- Separable verbs are just one of those things you can't avoid.  Many extremely common verbs, such as 'to sleep' (睡觉) or 'to meet' (见面) are separable verbs, and until you understand which verbs are separable verbs and how they work, you'll forever be making mistakes with these words, even in very basic sentences. In addition, you will continue to encounter new separable verbs, and being already familiar with the concept makes mastering new words much easier.<br>- There is some debate as to how useful the concept of separable verbs really is.  For our purposes, we're only concerned with whether or not separable verbs are a useful conceptfor the student of Mandarin Chinese.  Many learners do, in fact, find the concept to be quite useful in helping them speak more natural Chinese.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG4GVRX		{}
Subj. + Verb + 给 + Recipient + Obj.<br>他送给我 一 束 花 。		- Verbs followed by 'gei'<br>- Although it's standard practice to put a word or phrase that modifies a verbbeforethe verb, there are, of course, exceptions.给(gěi) is one of those exceptions;it sometimes comes before the verband sometimes after. This article is about when it comes after.<br>- Note that the verbs that fit into this pattern are normally single-syllable verbs.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 给 + Recipient + Obj.<br>- or<br>- Obj. + Subj. + Verb + 给 + Recipient<br><ruby>昨天 有 人送 给我 一 束 花 。<rt>Zuótiān  yǒu rén sòng gěi wǒ yī shù huā.</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday someone gave me a bouquet of flowers.<br><ruby>请递 给我 一 盒 纸巾 。<rt>Qǐng dì gěi wǒ yī hé zhǐjīn.</rt></ruby><br>Please pass me a box of tissues.<br><ruby>这是 我们送 给你的 生日 礼物 。<rt>Zhè shì wǒmen sòng gěi nǐ de shēngrì lǐwù.</rt></ruby><br>This is your birthday present from us.<br><hr><br>- Additionally, you canadd 把into this structure.

Why have it both ways?  There is some academic debate over whether this 给 is actually apreposition, a type of verb (often called a 'co-verb'), or even a type ofcomplement.  This type of discussion is outside the scope of this article, however.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMMHTQ		{}
Subj. + 给 + Target + Verb + Obj.<br>现在 不要给他 打 电话 。		- Verbs preceded by 'gei'<br>- The word 给 (gěi) literally means 'to give' but is frequently used in Chinese to indicate thetargetof a verb. The target is who or what the verb is aimed or directed at.<br>- Subj. + 给 + Target + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>现在 不要给他打 电话。<rt>Xiànzài bùyào gěi tā dǎ diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>Don't give him a phone call now.<br><ruby>请 快点给我回 邮件。<rt>Qǐng kuàidiǎn gěi wǒ huí yóujiàn.</rt></ruby><br>Please hurry up and reply to my email.<br><ruby>他 说 他 会给我写 信的 。<rt>Tā shuō tā huì gěi wǒ xiě xìn de.</rt></ruby><br>He said he would write letters to me.<br><hr><br>- Chinese speakers use 给 in some interesting ways, similar to how English speakers use 'to give,' as in 'to give someone a phone call' or 'to give someone a reply.'<br>- Although the structure above is the best one to learn first, some verbs frequently use 给 but have the 给 coming after the verb, rather than before. It's best to think of these as exceptions to the rule above, and you can learn more about these exceptions by reading aboutverbs followed by 'gei'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG3ORNN		{}
Verb + 得⋯⋯<br>你 做得 不错。		- Degree complement<br>- While mostcomplementsfollowverbs, degree complements can follow both verbs andadjectives.  These complements intensify or modify the degree of expression of the verb or adjective.<br>- Until now, you may have been getting by just fine modifying your verbs with adverbs. You can use 非常 to say 'very' and all that. Great. But once you learn to use degree complements, a whole new layer of expressiveness is infused into your language. You will be able to expressdegreeof verbs and adjectives with much more precision and color. But how do you knowwhen to usethe degree complement?  Here are the main reasons to use it:<br>- 1. To expresshowaverbhappened or assess its quality<br>- 2. To expressto what extent(or degree) anadjectiveis true<br>- For the first case, the most typical examples would be describinghow wellan action is done, or inaskinghow well an action is done, which are sometimes also classified asdescriptive complementsandstate complements.<br>- We can use all kinds of degree complements to add some color to our verbs.<br>- Verb + 得 + [Degree Complement]<br><ruby>你 做得 不错。<rt>Nǐ zuò de bùcuò.</rt></ruby><br>You're doing a great job.<br><ruby>孩子们 学得 挺 快 的。<rt>Háizi men xué de tǐng kuài de.</rt></ruby><br>The kids are learning fast.<br><ruby>我 吃得 太 饱了。<rt>Wǒ chī de tài bǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>I'm stuffed.<br><hr><br>- Both adding a complement to a verb with an object and adding an objective to a verb with a complement  complicate a sentence in Mandarin, becausea single verb cannot be followed by both an object and a complement. In order to get all three pieces of information into a grammatically correct Chinese sentence, there are two approaches to take:<br>- Approach #1: Repeat the Verb<br><hr><br>- Just like little kids, objects and complements don't know how to share. Make sure each gets its own (identical) verb. Also make sure that the object comes after the first instance of the verb, and the complement after the second.<br>- Approach #2: Move the Object to the Front<br><hr><br>- Note: the 你的中文 in the sentence above can also be 你中文 (without the 的). When it makes sense to include the 的, it often sounds better.<br>- Just to be completely clear, the following sentences are bothincorrect:<br><hr><br>- A few more examples:<br><ruby>你做菜做得 很 好。<rt>Nǐ zuò cài zuò de hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>You cook very well.<br><ruby>你 的菜做得 很 好。<rt>Nǐ de cài zuò de hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>You cook very well.<br><hr><br><ruby>你写字写得 很 漂亮。<rt>Nǐ xiě zì xiě de hěn piàoliang.</rt></ruby><br>Your handwriting is beautiful.<br><ruby>你 的字写得 很 漂亮。<rt>Nǐ de zì xiě de hěn piàoliang.</rt></ruby><br>Your handwriting is beautiful.<br><hr><br>- There are three especially common degree complements which can follow adjectives immediately and arenotpreceded by a 得:<br><ruby>味道好极了。<rt>Wèidào hǎo jíle.</rt></ruby><br>The taste is amazing.<br><ruby>这里 的 天气舒服极了。<rt>Zhèlǐ de tiānqì shūfu jíle.</rt></ruby><br>The weather here is so comfortable.<br><hr><br><ruby>他 的 袜子臭死了。<rt>Tā de wàzi chòu sǐle.</rt></ruby><br>His socks totally reek.<br><ruby>小狗可爱死了。<rt>Xiǎogǒu kě'ài sǐle.</rt></ruby><br>The puppy is so adorable! <br><hr><br><ruby>老师 说 今天 没有 作业 ，我们 都高兴坏了。<rt>Lǎoshī shuō jīntiān méiyǒu zuòyè, wǒmen dōu gāoxìng huàile.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher said there's no homework for today, which thrilled us all.<br><ruby>找 不 到 孩子 ，妈妈急坏了。<rt>Zhǎo bu dào háizi, māma jí huàile.</rt></ruby><br>Having not found the child, the mother was an anxious wreck.<br><hr><br>- Note that 死 can also act as aresult complementin verb phrases such as 打死 (literally, 'beat to death'). In the examples above, however, it merely indicates an extreme degree (no actual deaths involved!).<br>- Some sentences that contain adjective complements may be indistinguishable as degree or potential complements when they are taken out of context. The following table explains different meanings that one complement phrase could have as either a degree complement or potential complement.<br><ruby>她说得清楚she is able to speak clearly (Potential Complement Translation)<rt>tā shuō de qīngchu</rt></ruby><br>she speaks clearly (Degree Complement Translation)<br><ruby>他们做得好they are able to do it well (Potential Complement Translation)<rt>tāmen zuò de hǎo</rt></ruby><br>they do it well (Degree Complement Translation)<br><ruby>他跑得快he is able to run fast (Potential Complement Translation)<rt>tā pǎo de kuài</rt></ruby><br>he runs fast (Degree Complement Translation)<br><hr><br>- Degree complements are commonly directly preceded by an adverb like 很. For example: 她说得很清楚. This serves to distinguish them from potential complements, which are never directly preceded by an adverb.<br>- Not every aspect of Chinese grammar is agreed upon in the world of academia, and this is the case with degree complements,descriptive complements, andstate complements. Some scholars hold that the three are distinct, while others posit they're all just types of degree complements. Still, others maintain that degree complements are one, and descriptive complements and state complements are also one.<br>- Here's how a professor of Chinese at Yale puts it[1]:<br>- Generally speaking, the complement of degree is a grammatical unit that describes the main verb of the sentence. Specifically, the complement of degree is an assessment of an action or a description of the consequential state of an action. It may also be a description of the degree of a state.<br>- Okayyy, so it sounds like descriptions and states are all degree complements? That's one of the views on the issue.<br>- None of these classifications truly matters though: the key isunderstandingthem andusingcomplements correctly to express yourself in Chinese. (This is already difficult without adding in unnecessary academic distinctions!)	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG79STE		{}
Verb (+ Direction) + 来 / 去<br>我们 走过去吧 。		- Direction complement<br>- A direction complement is acomplementused to describe the direction of a verb. Verbs often already have some inherent movement implied, but by adding a direction complement, it becomes clearer where, exactly, that action is going.<br>- The most basic (and common) form of direction complement is formed by a verb and 来 or 去.<br>- Verb + 来 / 去<br>- The most important thing to consider with direction complements isthe position of the speaker. If the action moves towards the speaker or comes closer in any way, use 来. If the action moves away from the speaker or becomes more distant in any way, use 去.<br>- You might be wondering how the directional distinction between 来 and 去 works when you're talking about yourself moving. You can't move away from or towards yourself, so should it be 来 or 去? The answer is to look at the context of the movement you're talking about. Are you telling someone you'll see them tomorrow? Similar to English, in Chinese you'd say something like 'I'll come and see you tomorrow.'<br>- You can use these simple compounds in a huge variety of situations. Here are some example dialogs to provide a little more context:<br>- Direction complements can be more complex than just 来 or 去.<br>- You can form compound direction complements in the following way:<br>- These compounds can then be used in much the same way as 来 and 去. Attach them to verbs to give detail about the direction of the action.<br>- Verb + [Compound Direction Complement]<br><ruby>请 站起来。<rt>Qǐng zhàn qǐlái.</rt></ruby><br>Please stand up.<br><ruby>不要 让 它 跑出去。<rt>Bùyào ràng tā pǎo chūqù.</rt></ruby><br>Don't let it run out.<br><ruby>从 我 家 走过来要 半 个 小时 。<rt>Cóng wǒ jiā zǒu guòlái yào bàn gè xiǎoshí.</rt></ruby><br>It took me half an hour to walk here from my place.<br><hr><br>- Direction complements are not only used to describe the movement of people. Moving objects can also be described with direction complements. Again, the direction of the movement relative to the speaker (or at least to the context of the conversation) is important when deciding what complement to use.<br>- The verbs that commonly appear in this construction include 拿, 送, and 带.<br>- Verb + Object + Complement<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>服务员 ，请 再 拿几 个 碗来。<rt>Fúwùyuán, qǐng zài ná jǐ gè wǎn lái.</rt></ruby><br>Waiter, please bring a few more bowls.<br><ruby>快点 送孩子去吧 ，别 迟到 了 。<rt>Kuàidiǎn sòng háizi qù ba, bié chídào le.</rt></ruby><br>Hurry up, send the  kids off. Don't be late.<br><ruby>师傅 ，送两 桶 水来。<rt>Shīfu, sòng liǎng tǒng shuǐ lái.</rt></ruby><br>Shifu, please deliver two buckets of water.<br><hr><br>- Although 回来 and 回去 can be compound complements, they can each also just be the verb 回 with a simple direction complement. Many Chinese learners make the following mistakes:<br><hr><br>- You can't say 回来中国 because 回 is the verb, 来 is the complement, and 中国 is the object. You can't put both a complement and an object after a single verb, but it's OK to put just a 来 or 去 after the object. In spoken language, if the context is clear, people often omit 来 or 去 and only say 回美国 or 回中国.<br>- Direction complements work very well in把 sentences, as they can be used to describe the disposal of an object (what happened to it in the end). Because of this, it's very common to see direction complements and 把 appearing together.<br>- Subj. + 把 + Obj. + Verb + [Direction Complement]<br><ruby>把书拿 出来。<rt>Bǎ shū ná chūlai.</rt></ruby><br>Take out your book.<br><ruby>把手举 起来。<rt>Bǎ shǒu jǔ qǐlái.</rt></ruby><br>Raise your hands.<br><ruby>帮 我把这个 箱子搬 过去。<rt>Bāng wǒ bǎ zhège xiāngzi bān guòqù.</rt></ruby><br>Help me move this suitcase over there.<br><hr><br>- See also:把 sentences<br>- Adding 得 to directional complements makes the phrase an affirmative potential complement. Adding 不 makes the phrase a negative potential complement.<br><hr><br>- A lot of direction complements, particularly compound direction complements, have additional idiomatic meanings beyond literally describing the direction of an action. The most common of these are:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8LWBJ		{}
Verb / Adj.+ 起来<br>天气 热起来了。		- Direction complement '-qilai'<br>- 起来 (qǐlái) comes up very frequently in Chinese and can be used both literally and figuratively. This is a little like the usage of 'up' in English, which can be used literally, as in 'stand up,' or figuratively, as in 'add up.' When used figuratively, 起来 often serves as  adirection complement.<br>- 起来 can be used to express an upward movement like 'up,' as in the English examples of 'stand up' or 'pick up.'<br>- Verb + 起来<br><ruby>请 大家站起来。<rt>Qǐng dàjiā zhàn qǐlái.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone, please stand up.<br><ruby>捡起来。<rt>Jiǎn qǐlái.</rt></ruby><br>Pick it up (from the floor).<br><ruby>头抬起来。<rt>Tóu tái qǐlái.</rt></ruby><br>Raise your head.<br><hr><br>- 起来 can also be used to show that an action or state has started and is ongoing:<br>- Verb / Adj. + 起来 +了<br><ruby>小鸟 飞起来了。<rt>Xiǎoniǎo fēi qǐlái le .</rt></ruby><br>The birds started flying.<br><ruby>宝宝 哭起来了。<rt>Bǎobao kū qǐlái le.</rt></ruby><br>The baby started crying.<br><ruby>两 个 大妈 吵起来了。<rt>Liǎng gè dàmā chǎo qǐlái le.</rt></ruby><br>Two middle-aged ladies started arguing.<br><hr><br>- When used like this, 起来 is only used with spontaneous actions, like 唱 (chàng),  跳 (tiào),  聊 (liáo), or with states like 热 (rè),  冷 (lěng), or 好 (hǎo) etc. It cannot be used with planned actions.<br><hr><br>- It can also used as a way to encourage people to start doing something immediately:<br><ruby>大家唱起来，跳起来!<rt>Dàjiā chàng qǐlái, tiào qǐlái !</rt></ruby><br>Let's sing and dance, everybody!<br><hr><br>- 起来 is used here to express that the speaker has only just initiated an action, and based on that, has made a preliminary judgment. It is used in the following structure:<br>- Subj. + Verb + 起来 + Adv. + Adj.<br>- This expresses that the subject seemsadjectivewhen the action of the verb is performed. This structure is frequently used with perception verbs such as 看, 听, 闻, 摸, etc.<br><ruby>他看 起来很 友好。<rt>Tā kàn qǐlái hěn yǒuhǎo.</rt></ruby><br>He looks very friendly.<br><ruby>你 的 头发闻 起来很 香。<rt>Nǐ de tóufa wén qǐlái hěn xiāng.</rt></ruby><br>Your hair smells good.<br><ruby>这 件 事情听 起来有点 复杂。<rt>Zhè jiàn shìqing  tīng qǐlái yǒudiǎn fùzá.</rt></ruby><br>This matter sounds a little bit complex.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGBPXOB		{}
Verb + 得 / 不 + Complement<br>做得完 / 做不完		- Potential complement<br>- Verbs can take potential complements to indicate whether or not an action is possible. Potential complements contain a 得 (de) or a 不 (bu) immediate after the verb being modified, and are quite common in everyday spoken Mandarin.<br>- Structurally, potential complements are closely related to bothresult complementsanddirection complements, so it helps to be familiar with those first. The most important and commonly used potential complements are derived from other complements such as the following:<br>- These forms will be our starting point for forming potential complements.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 得 + Complement<br><ruby>你 没 戴 眼镜 ，看得清楚吗 ？<rt>Nǐ méi dài yǎnjìng, kàn de qīngchu ma?</rt></ruby><br>You didn't wear glasses. Can you see clearly?<br><ruby>他 这么 粗心 ，做得好吗 ？<rt>Tā zhème cūxīn, zuò de hǎo ma?</rt></ruby><br>He'a so careless. Can he do it well?<br><ruby>你 这么 聪明 ，肯定 学得会。<rt>Nǐ zhème cōngming, kěndìng xué de huì.</rt></ruby><br>You're so smart. You can definitely learn this.<br><hr><br>- The only difference between the affirmative and negative forms is swapping a 得 for a 不.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 不 + Complement<br><ruby>你 的 声音 太 小 了 ，我们 听不见。<rt>Nǐ de shēngyīn tài xiǎo le, wǒmen tīng bu jiàn.</rt></ruby><br>Your voice is too soft. We can't hear you.<br><ruby>这里 太 暗 了 ，我 看不清楚。<rt>Zhèlǐ tài àn le, wǒ kàn bu qīngchu.</rt></ruby><br>It's too dim here. I can't see clearly.<br><ruby>这个 自行车 太 破 了 ，谁 都 修不好。<rt>Zhège zìxíngchē tài pò le, shéi dōu xiū bu hǎo .</rt></ruby><br>This bike is so beaten up. Nobody can fix it.<br><hr><br>- Objects in sentences with potential complements can occur either after the complement or at the beginning of a sentence.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>你 听得懂上海话 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ tīng de dǒng Shànghǎi-huà ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you understand Shanghai dialect?<br><ruby>她 这么 小 ，看得懂这 本 书 吗 ？<rt>Tā zhème xiǎo, kàn de dǒng zhè běn shū ma?</rt></ruby><br>She's so young. Can she really understand this book?<br><ruby>我怕 我 做不好这份 工作 。<rt>Wǒ pà wǒ zuò bu hǎo zhè fèn gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid that I can't do this job well.<br><hr><br>- There are actually quite a few potential complements out there, and this article touches on some of the simplest and most common ones. Be aware that there are many more, but they all follow the same basic pattern outlined here. You can also refer to our article onadvanced potential complements.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCPJPQ		{}
Verb + 好 / 完 / 错<br>我们 吃好了 。		- Result complements<br>- Result complements come immediately after verbs to indicate that an action has led to a certain result and make that result clear to the listener. Often the complement is simply an adjective like 好 (hǎo) or a single syllable like 完 (wán).<br>- 好 (hǎo) implies that something is done tocompletionor donewell.  Forming a result complement with 好 has a very similar meaning toforming one with 完. It expresses that the action has been completed successfully.<br>- 错 (cuò) is used to express that an action has been performed incorrectly in some way, resulting in a mistake (错). This pattern covers what is often expressed with the adverb 'incorrectly' in English.<br>- Otheradjectivescommonly used as result complements include: 晚 (wǎn), 饱 (bǎo), 坏 (huài), 清楚 (qīngchu), 干净 (gānjìng), 破 (pò).<br>- For the basic structure, you'll almost always see a 了 after the complement:<br>- Subj. + Verb + Adj. + 了 (+ Obj.)<br>- To negate a result complement, use 没 instead of 不:<br>- Subj. + 没 + Verb + Adj. (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>你 吃好了吗 ？<rt>Nǐ chī hǎo le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you done eating?<br><ruby>对不起 ，我 记错了时间 。<rt>Duìbuqǐ, wǒ jì cuò le shíjiān.</rt></ruby><br>Sorry, I misremembered the time.<br><ruby>你 来晚了，我们 已经 关门了。<rt>Nǐ lái wǎn le, wǒmen yǐjīng guānmén le.</rt></ruby><br>You came too late. We're already closed.<br><hr><br>- When using result complements, it's very common to make the object atopic. This means the object is moved to the beginning of the sentence and the subject is often omitted.<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>这 个 字写错了。<rt>Zhège zì xiě cuò le.</rt></ruby><br>You wrote this character wrong.<br><ruby>杯子摔坏了 。<rt>Bēizi shuāi huài le.</rt></ruby><br>The cup is broken.<br><ruby>房间打扫干净了 吗 ？<rt>Fángjiān dǎsǎo gānjìng le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is your room all cleaned up?<br><hr><br>- Besides adjectives, there are a few single-syllable verbs which can also be used as result complements. Some examples include到 (dào), 见 (jiàn), 懂 (dǒng), 会 (huì), 走 (zǒu), 掉 (diào). There really aren't a lot of these, which is part of the reason why these are usually seen as one verb instead of a verb-complement structure.<br>- For the basic structure, you'll often see a 了 after the complement:<br>- Subj. + Verb + [One-syllable Verb] +了 (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>你们 都听 懂了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen dōu tīng dǒng le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you all understand?<br><ruby>我 看 了 ，但是 没看 懂。<rt>Wǒ kàn le, dànshì méi kàn dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>I read it, but I didn't really understand it.<br><hr><br><ruby>你踩 到了 我 的 脚 。<rt>Nǐ cǎi dào le wǒ de jiǎo.</rt></ruby><br>You're stepping on my foot.<br><ruby>我 不小心撞 到了 墙 。<rt>Wǒ bù xiǎoxīn zhuàng dào le qiáng.</rt></ruby><br>I hit the wall by accident.<br><hr><br><ruby>我 女儿学 会了 数数 。<rt>Wǒ nǚ'ér xué huì le shǔ shù.</rt></ruby><br>My daughter has learned how to count.<br><ruby>我 爸爸 还 没学 会用 智能 手机 。<rt>Wǒ bàba hái méi xué huì yòng zhìnéng shǒujī.</rt></ruby><br>My father hasn't learned how to use a smartphone yet.<br><hr><br><ruby>老师拿 走了 我 的 iPad 。<rt>Lǎoshī ná zǒu le wǒ de iPad.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher took away my iPad.<br><ruby>小偷偷 走了 我 的 钱包 。<rt>Xiǎotōu tōu zǒu le wǒ de qiánbāo.</rt></ruby><br>The thief stole my wallet.<br><hr><br><ruby>他 不小心推 倒了 一 个 老人 。<rt>Tā bù xiǎoxīn tuī dǎo le yī gè lǎorén.</rt></ruby><br>He pushed over an old person by accident.<br><ruby>你撞 倒了 我 的 自行车 。<rt>Nǐ zhuàng dǎo le wǒ de zìxíngchē.</rt></ruby><br>You knocked over my bike.<br><hr><br><ruby>谁扔 掉了 我 的 袜子 ？<rt>Shéi rēng diào le wǒ de wàzi?</rt></ruby><br>Who threw away my socks?<br><ruby>我卖 掉了 我 的 旧 手机 。<rt>Wǒ mài diào le wǒ de jiù shǒujī.</rt></ruby><br>I sold my old cell phone.<br><hr><br><hr><br>- Although we have avoided把 sentencesin this article for the sake of simplicity, you may have noticed that sentences which feature result complements often also use 把. This is because 把 sentences and result complements work particularly well together, as they both deal with the result of an action or the 'disposal' of an object. Apart from result complements involving perception and psychological verbs, most result compounds work nicely in 把 sentences.<br><ruby>我把杯子摔 坏了 。<rt>Wǒ bǎ bēizi shuāi huài le .</rt></ruby><br>I broke the glass.<br><ruby>他把我 的 电脑修 好了 。<rt>Tā bǎ wǒ de diànnǎo xiū hǎo le .</rt></ruby><br>He fixed my computer.<br><ruby>小偷把我 的 钱包偷 走了 。<rt>Xiǎotōu bǎ wǒ de qiánbāo tōu zǒu le .</rt></ruby><br>The thief made off with my wallet.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNNMST		{}
Verb + 下去<br>这个 故事 太 无聊 了 ，我 听不 下去了。		- Result complement '-xiaqu'<br>- 下去 (xiàqù) can be used as aresult complementto talk about thingscontinuingorcarrying on. Think of it as a figurative way of 'keeping the ball rolling' (downhill).<br>- Structure-wise, this pattern is the same as otherresult complements.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 下去<br><ruby>说下去。<rt>Shuō xiàqù.</rt></ruby><br>Keep talking.<br><ruby>这 本 书 你 一定 要 认真 地看下去。<rt>Zhè běn shū nǐ yīdìng yào rènzhēn de kàn xiàqù.</rt></ruby><br>You must keep reading this book carefully.<br><ruby>这样 做 很 有 意义 ，你 应该做下去。<rt>Zhèyàng zuò hěn yǒu yìyì, nǐ yīnggāi zuò xiàqù.</rt></ruby><br>It's very meaningful to do this. You should keep doing it.<br><hr><br>- Strictly speaking, simply adding 不 in front of the main verb is all it takes to create the negative form. But it's actually more common to use this negativepotential complementform. So it's not just 'not go on' (doing something), but actually 'can'tgo on' (doing something).<br>- Subj. + Verb + 不 + 下去 (+ 了)<br>- Note that 了 is often used when it's negated.<br><ruby>这个 故事 太 无聊 了 ，我 听不 下去了。<rt>Zhège gùshi tài wúliáo le, wǒ tīng bu xiàqù le.</rt></ruby><br>This story is too boring, I can't keep listening.<br><ruby>这个 电影 太 暴力 了 ，我 看不 下去了。<rt>Zhège diànyǐng tài bàolì le, wǒ kàn bu xiàqù le.</rt></ruby><br>This movie is too violent. I can't keep watching it.<br><ruby>你 说话 太 恶心 了 ，我 吃不 下去了。<rt>Nǐ shuōhuà tài ěxīn le, wǒ chī bu xiàqù le.</rt></ruby><br>The way you talk is so disgusting. I can't continue eating my food.<br><hr><br>- When the adverb再comes before the verb, there's an implication that if 'things keep going on this way,' then something bad is going to happen.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>你再赌下去会输光 的 。<rt>Nǐ zài dǔ xiàqù huì shūguāng de.</rt></ruby><br>If you keep gambling, you're going to lose all your money.<br><ruby>你再喝下去就醉 了 。<rt>Nǐ zài hē xiàqù jiù zuì le.</rt></ruby><br>If you keep drinking you're going to get drunk.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1PTJX		{}
所有 (+ 的) + Noun<br>我 喜欢 吃所有我 妈妈 做 的 菜 。		- Expressing 'all' with 'suoyou'<br>- You can use 所有 (suǒyǒu) to say 'all of' something. It's what you use to say phrases like 'all the money in the world' or 'all of my friends.'<br>- This pattern is used to refer to 'all' of a noun, with the quantity of said noun usually being fairly large. You may notice that the 的 after 所有 is occasionally omitted.<br>- 所有 (+ 的) + Noun<br><ruby>你 买 了 她所有 的书 ？<rt>Nǐ mǎi le tā suǒyǒu de shū?</rt></ruby><br>You've bought all her books?<br><ruby>我 喜欢所有我 妈妈 做 的 菜 。<rt>Wǒ xǐhuan suǒyǒu wǒ māma zuò de cài.</rt></ruby><br>I like all the food my mom cooks.<br><ruby>他 记得所有朋友 的 生日 。<rt>Tā jìde suǒyǒu péngyou de shēngrì.</rt></ruby><br>He remembers all of his friends' birthdays.<br><hr><br>- When you make 所有 part of the subject, you're typically going to need 都 before the predicate.<br>- 所有 (+ 的) + Noun + 都 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>所有人都走 了 吗 ？<rt>Suǒyǒu rén dōu zǒu le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did all the people leave?<br><ruby>所有 的学校都放假 了。<rt>Suǒyǒu de xuéxiào dōu fàngjià le.</rt></ruby><br>All the schools are out for the holiday.<br><ruby>我们 学校所有 的老师都会 说 英文 。<rt>Wǒmen xuéxiào suǒyǒu de lǎoshī dōu huì shuō Yīngwén.</rt></ruby><br>All the teachers in our school can speak English.<br><hr><br>- Take note that you use 不是 rather than just 不 to negate 所有.<br>- 不是 + 所有 (+ 的) + Noun + 都 + Predicate<br><ruby>不是所有 的美国 人都爱 喝 咖啡 。<rt>Bù shì suǒyǒu de Měiguó rén dōu ài hē kāfēi.</rt></ruby><br>Not all Americans like drinking coffee.<br><ruby>不是所有问题都能 用 钱 来 解决 。<rt>Bù shì suǒyǒu wèntí dōu néng yòng qián lái jiějué.</rt></ruby><br>Not all problems can be solved with money.<br><ruby>不是所有朋友都愿意 帮 他 。<rt>Bù shì suǒyǒu péngyou dōu yuànyì bāng tā.</rt></ruby><br>Not all of his friends are willing to help him.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGOWBSL		{}
⋯⋯之一<br>你 是 我 最 好 的 朋友之一。		- Expressing 'one of' with 'zhiyi'<br>- 之一 (zhīyī) is a simple phrase which means 'one of.' Although it uses the somewhat archaic word 之 (zhī), it's quite common in spoken Chinese, and is even commonly used in jokes.<br>- In order to express 'one of' in Chinese, 之一 (zhī yī) can be used at the end of a noun phrase, which is often modified with 最 (zuì), meaning 'the most.'<br>- Subj. + 是 + [Noun Phrase] + 之一<br>- [Noun Phrase] + 之一 + 是 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>她 是 我最 好的 朋友之 一。<rt>Tā shì wǒ zuì hǎo de péngyou zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>She is one of my best friends.<br><ruby>Frozen 是 我最 喜欢的 迪斯尼 电影之 一。<rt>Frozen shì wǒ zuì xǐhuan de Dísīní diànyǐng zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>Frozen is one of my favorite Disney movies.<br><ruby>纽约 是 世界 上最 国际化的 城市之 一。<rt>Niǔyuē shì shìjiè shàng zuì guójìhuà de chéngshì zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>New York is the one of the most international cities in the world.<br><hr><br>- A joke you'll hear a lot in Chinese involves using 最... but then pausing before saying 之一. This can leave the impression that you're saying someone or something is 'the best,' but really you're saying 'one ofthe best,' which can make a big difference (and is not nearly as complimentary).<br><ruby>她 是 我最 好的 朋友 ……之一。<rt>Tā shì wǒ zuì hǎo de péngyou... zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>She is my best friend... well, one of them.<br><ruby>你 是 我最 喜欢的 老师 ……之一。<rt>Nǐ shì wǒ zuì xǐhuan de lǎoshī... zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>You are my favorite teacher... well, one of them.<br><ruby>中国 是 我最 爱的 地方 ……之一。<rt>Zhōngguó shì wǒ zuì ài de dìfang... zhī yī.</rt></ruby><br>China is my favorite place... well, one of them.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMT1M1		{}
另外 + Number + Measure Word + Noun<br>我 有 两 个 手机 ，一 个 是 小米 ，另一 个 是 iPhone 。		- Expressing 'the other' with 'lingwai'<br>- 另外 (lìngwài) or 另 (lìng) is often used as a pronoun to denote 'the other.' There is no need to add 的 after 另外, but it's often followed by 一个.<br>- 另外 + Number + [Measure Word] + Noun<br>- 另 can be used instead of 另外 when the following noun is singular (frequently as part of the phrase '另一个').<br><ruby>我 有 两 个 手机 ，一 个 是 小米 ，另一 个 是 iPhone 。<rt>Wǒ yǒu liǎng gè shǒujī, yī gè shì Xiǎomǐ, lìng yī gè shì iPhone.</rt></ruby><br>I have two cell phones.

不 是…… 吗 ？<br>不 是 说好 了 吗 ？怎么 会 这样 ？		- Simple rhetorical questions<br>- Rhetorical questions are ones where the speaker doesn't really expect an answer. The answer should be obvious, and the question is asked in order to make a point.<br>- There are several very common types of rhetorical questions using basic words you already know:<br>- 不是……吗？<br>- This first one is the easiest and most common. It can be quite friendly, seemingly reminding the other person of a fact they seem to have (conveniently?) forgotten.<br>- 能……吗？<br>- This one is often quite sarcastic, pointing out someone else's unrealistic expectations. (The obvious answer is 'no' here.)<br>- 怎么会……？<br>- This second one has a tone of incredulity. The speaker clearly thinks this shouldn't have happened, or thought it couldn't have happened.<br>- 谁让你……？<br>- The third one is exclusively used by surly or annoyed people. It means 'who told you to...?' or 'who made you...?'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD4EC8		{}
是⋯⋯ 的<br>你是怎么 来的？		- The 'shi... de' construction for emphasizing details<br>- The 是⋯⋯的 (shì... de) construction is used to draw attention to certain information in a sentence. It's often used to ask questions that seek specific information, or to explain a situation by emphasizing a particular detail. While not strictly tied to any 'tense,' the 是⋯⋯的 construction is frequently used when asking or tellingdetailsabout the past.<br>- This use of 是⋯⋯的 (shì... de) is usually emphasized in textbooks over other uses, and therefore is sometimes called the 'classic' 是⋯⋯的 construction.<br>- Even if you understand that 了 is not used to mark 'past tense' in Chinese, it's possible that you incorrectly use it that way sometimes. For example, what if you want to ask a question about something that happened in the past? Would you ever say one of the following sentences?<br><hr><br>- In each of these sentences above, 了 is not the right choice, because you're not asking if an event happened or not. You're asking about details of past events. When you are singling out details for emphasis--in a question or a statement--you need to use the 是⋯⋯的 construction.<br>- A 是⋯⋯的 construction can pick out any detail that's related to a past event. Whatever comes immediately after 是 is emphasized. Check out this example:<br>- Now let's revisit those other three sentences and ask the questions correctly with 是⋯⋯的:<br><hr><br>- 是⋯⋯的 is not generally used for reporting new information but for adding important details that make the information clearer. You could think of 是⋯⋯的 as being equivalent to saying one of the following in English:<br>- Subj. + 是 + [Information to be Emphasized] + Verb + 的<br>- This structure can be used to emphasize any detail, but most commonly it emphasizestime,manner, orplace. Don't worry if this still seems a little confusing; lots of helpful examples are coming up!<br>- Although this structure is called the 是⋯⋯的 construction, the 是 is nearly always optional. You will often hear this structure with 是 omitted, so be aware. The only time 是 is required in this construction is when it's being negated. Other than that, 是 is commonly omitted.<br>- You might be wondering, 'can I still say the same thing without the 是 and the 的?' The answer is that in most cases,no, not really. While the 是 can sometimes be dropped, these examples sound weird without the 的. It's just a part of learning to ask questions naturally in Mandarin. You don't have to learn a 'past tense,' but you do have to learn this way of asking for details about the past sooner or later.<br>- 是⋯⋯的 sentences can only be negated with 不, as 没 can not be used to negate 是. Remember that you needboththe 不andthe 是 together to make the correct negative form.<br>- Some examples:<br>- Note that negating a 是⋯⋯的 construction creates the implication that the action in the sentencewascarried out, and only the detail emphasized by 是⋯⋯的 is being denied. So, in the second sentence, the implication is that 他 didn't go with 我们, butdidgo out withsomeone. So negative 是⋯⋯的 constructions would work nicely in the final scenes of detective dramas.<br>- 是⋯⋯的 constructions can be made into questions in the usual three ways to form questions in Chinese:<br>- Some examples:<br>- Generally, 是 can be omitted, and the meaning will not change. However, in a small number of cases, omitting 是 will make it unclear which part of the sentence is being emphasized. In these cases, 是 clearly indicates which words are being emphasized. Take a look at this example:<br><ruby>你 上周 和 他 去 北京的吗 ？<rt>Nǐ shàng zhōu hé tā qù Běijīng  de ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you go to Beijing with him last weekend?<br><hr><br>- This sentence could emphasize 上周 (time), or 和他 (part of the subject). A simple 是 can make clear which one the speaker is emphasizing.<br>- Until now we've said that the 的 appears at the end of the sentence in a 是⋯⋯的 construction. This is very often the case. However, it can actually appear in one of two places. Take a look at the examples below:<br><hr><br>- As you can see, when the verb is followed by an object, 的 can go beforeorafter the object. Both sentences are grammatically correct, but the first the sentence could be referring to either a specific event in the past or habitual actions.<br>- Take a look at these two sentences which remove the ambiguity by including a bit more information about the timeframe:<br><ruby>那次我们是用 Skype开会的。<rt> Nà cì wǒmen shì yòng Skype kāi huì de.</rt></ruby><br>That time we had the meeting by Skype.<br><ruby>我们平时是用 Skype开会的。<rt>Wǒmen píngshí shì yòng Skype kāi huì de.</rt></ruby><br>We usually have meetings by Skype.<br><hr><br>- For the most part, you should be fine regularly putting 的 at the end of your 是……的 sentences. Just be aware that there is some potential for ambiguity in certain situations. If you don't want to move 的 around, then including a bit of extra information about time can keep things clear.<br>- It's important to note that while the 是⋯⋯的 construction also indicates that an action has been completed, this is not thepurposeof a 是⋯⋯的 construction. The completed action part is more like aprerequisitefor using 是⋯⋯的. This means you shouldn't use 是⋯⋯的 just to indicate that an action is completed. Use theaspect particle 了for that. Instead, use 是⋯⋯的 to draw attention to certain details of a completed action.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGE662E		{}
是⋯⋯ 的<br>我是来 上海 旅游的。		- The 'shi... de' construction for indicating purpose<br>- There are many ways to explain why you are doing something or what an object is used for. One of the more natural ways just happens to involve 是⋯⋯的. This is a different usage from the'classic' 是⋯⋯的 pattern.<br>- If the subject is a person, there is often a 来 or 去 after the 是, indicating direction like 'coming here' or 'going there.'<br>- Person + 是 + 来 / 去 + Verb+ 的<br><ruby>我是来玩的。<rt>Wǒ shì lái wán de.</rt></ruby><br>I came for fun.<br><ruby>我们 都是去出差的。<rt>Wǒmen dōu shì qù chūchāi de.</rt></ruby><br>We are all going on business trips.<br><ruby>他们 都是来实习的。<rt>Tāmen dōu shì lái shíxí de.</rt></ruby><br>They all came here to do internships.<br><hr><br>- If the subject is a thing, 用来 is often used. Look at the examples below for some more clarification.<br>- Thing + 是 + 用来 + Verb + 的<br>- or<br>- Thing + 是 + 给 + Person + Verb + 的<br><ruby>这 种 菜是用来做 汤的。<rt>Zhè zhǒng cài shì yònglái zuò tāng de.</rt></ruby><br>This kind of vegetable is for making soup.<br><ruby>这个 房间是给客人 住的。<rt>Zhège fángjiān shì gěi kèrén zhù de.</rt></ruby><br>This room is for our guest to stay in.<br><ruby>这些 钱是给孩子 上 大学的。<rt>Zhèxiē qián shì gěi háizi shàng dàxué de.</rt></ruby><br>This money is for our child's college education.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG0UFR4		{}
是⋯⋯ 的<br>你是哪个 学校的？		- The 'shi... de' patterns: an overview<br>- An intermediate student of Chinese should be aware of the classic'shi... de' construction.  It's important to learn and use. But don't be tempted to think that the 'official' 是⋯⋯的 (shì... de) pattern is the only way that 是 and 的 can work together in a sentence!  There are multiple ways to use 是 and 的 together, and they can be used for different purposes. This article helps break down the various uses of 是⋯⋯的 and tackle the confusion head-on.<br>- This is the most simple way to use 是 with 的: you drop the noun and let 的 represent it. This usage requires context; otherwise the other person won't know what noun you are referring to. Having the 的 take the place of the noun is sort of like the way we say 'one' or 'it' in English. It's a basic substitution, but it's one that is very common and very helpful in everyday Chinese.<br>- If you're a good student, you learned the classic pattern forsimple sentences using adjectiveslong ago (you know, the 你很漂亮 type), and you know that you'renotsupposed to use 是 in these sentences.  But then you may have later come across some sentence patterns--apparently using adjectives--where youhaveto use 是 (and also 的).  These are sentences that use a special type of word (you might think of it as a special class of adjectives, if that helps) calleddistinguishing words.<br>- Subj. + 是 + [Distinguishing Words] + 的<br>- Pay attention to the 'distinguishing words' between 是 and 的.<br><ruby>这个 苹果是坏的。<rt>Zhège píngguǒ shì huài de.</rt></ruby><br>This apple is bad.<br><ruby>你 错 了 ，那个 人是女的。<rt>Nǐ cuò le, nàge rén shì nǚ de.</rt></ruby><br>You are mistaken. That person is a woman.<br><ruby>他 家 的 家具 都是中式的。<rt>Tā jiā de jiājù dōu shì Zhōng shì de.</rt></ruby><br>The furniture in his house is all in Chinese style.<br><hr><br>- Other 'distinguishing words' include colors, materials, sexes, and other categories that can have no degree.<br>- Subj. + 是 + [Information to be Emphasized] + Verb + 的<br>- This classic pattern is the one for emphasizing certaindetailsabout events in thepast.  It's often used to ask pointed questions about past events, and then to answer those questions. Usually, the situation is already established, and the speakers are trying to get more specific clarification, such as when, where, or how the action took place. When this is the case, the phrase that follows the 是 is the part of the situation that is being emphasized.<br>- It is also important to know that you can't use 了 in this type of sentence. 了 only tells you that the action is completed, not any of the other details that this construction is looking for. Since it is already understood that the action took place, the 了 is unhelpful and inappropriate. A more complete explanation of this particular usage can be found inthe article on 是……的 for emphasizing details.<br>- The examples below share the theme: 我在上海学了两年中文. Each sentence has a different aspect of the situation being emphasized.<br>- In the example above, you might have noticed something funny with the object of the verb. In this construction, if the verb is transitive (it takes an object), then the object can be placed either before or after the 的 without affecting the meaning. Take a look at the example below:<br>- It's correct to put the 的 beforeorafter the 家 in both of those sentences.<br>- When explaining 'what you came for' or 'what you want to do,' it's common to use yetanother type of 是⋯⋯的 construction.<br>- Person + 是 + 来 / 去 + Verb + 的<br>- When expressing a purpose, 是 and 的 are often used together with 用来, especially when the subject is a thing.<br>- Thing + 是 + 用来 + Verb + 的<br><ruby>我是来实习的。<rt>Wǒ shì lái shíxí de.</rt></ruby><br>I came here to do an internship.<br><ruby>钱是用来花的，不是用来省的。<rt>Qián shì yònglái huā de,  bù shì yònglái shěng de.</rt></ruby><br>Money is for spending, not for saving.<br><hr><br>- This pattern can also be used to talk about what kind of work people do:<br>- Sometimes you can use 的 to really add a kick to your responses, making them stronger. You might even hear Chinese people reply with just 是的 which means 'That's right.' This usage is similar to the way that English speakers might stress the word 'is' in sentences like 'Itismy food.' When used to express affirmation, 会, 能, and 可以 are often used as well. Again, the 是 is optional.<br><ruby>这个 东西是可以吃的。<rt>Zhège dōngxi shì kěyǐ chī de.</rt></ruby><br>This thing is edible.<br><ruby>我会去的。<rt>Wǒ huì qù de.</rt></ruby><br>I will go.<br><ruby>我们能做到的。<rt>Wǒmen néng zuòdào de.</rt></ruby><br>We can do it.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8YTSF		{}
Topic，Comment<br>那 部 电影，看 过 的 人 都 喜欢 。		- Topic-comment sentences<br>- In a topic-comment sentence, the usualword orderis rearranged a bit, in order to emphasize a certain part of a sentence.  The part that is to be emphasized becomes the topic and moves to the beginning of the sentence, with the comment on the topic coming after the topic has been stated.<br>- Topic ，Comment<br>- Just make sure to put a comma after the topic if you are writing the sentence down!<br><ruby>水果，我 最爱 吃 草莓 。<rt>Shuǐguǒ, wǒ zuì ài chī cǎoméi.</rt></ruby><br>Fruit, I like strawberries best.<br><ruby>不 好意思 ，咖啡，我 都 喝完 了 。<rt>Bù hǎoyìsi, kāfēi, wǒ dōu hē wán le.</rt></ruby><br>I'm sorry. I finished all the coffee.<br><ruby>你好 ，票，还有 吗 ？<rt>Nǐhǎo, piào, háiyǒu ma?</rt></ruby><br>Hello. Are there any tickets left?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5KNWW		{}
Subj. + 把 + Obj.+ Verb Phrase<br>我把 书看 完 了。		- Using 'ba' sentences<br>- The 把 (bǎ) sentence is a useful structure for constructing longer sentences which focus on the result or influence of an action. One of its key features is that it brings the object of the verb closer to the front of the sentence and precedes it with a 把. It's really common in Mandarin but can feel a bit awkward at first for English speakers.<br>- A basic sentence in Mandarin is formed with a subject-verb-object (SVO)word order, as in English:<br>- Subj. + [Verb Phrase] + Obj.<br>- A 把 sentence shakes things up a bit, and you get this structure:<br>- Subj. + 把 + Obj. + [Verb Phrase]<br>- Note that theobject has moved, and is preceded by 把. You now have SOV word order.<br>- This is all well and good, but most students of Chinese, on learning about 把 sentences for the first time, have the same reaction:'Why the heck would I ever use this structure?  The SVO word order always works just fine, right?'The answer is: well, no... not always.  It's true that 把 sentences are often used to achieve somewhat subtle differences in emphasis, but there are also very good reasons to use 把 sentences when a regular sentence just won't do. Take this sentence for example:<br><ruby>把书放在桌子上。<rt>Bǎ shū fàng zài zhuōzi shàng.</rt></ruby><br>Put the book on the table.<br><hr><br>- How would you say this without the 把 construction? You might try this:<br><ruby>她把我 的 手机放在她 的 包里了 。<rt>Tā bǎ wǒ de shǒujī fàng zài tā de bāo lǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>She put my cell phone in her bag.<br><ruby>他把脏 衣服放在床下面了 。<rt>Tā bǎ zāng yīfu fàng zài chuáng xiàmiàn le.</rt></ruby><br>He put his dirty laundry under the bed.<br><hr><br>- The problem is that the above Chinese sentence is not grammatical.You can't put an object right after a verb, and then put other modifiers of the verb after the object.Here are other examples of how to successfully use 把 and 放 in the same sentence.<br>- For each of these, the sentence would be ungrammatical if you tried to do away with the 把 and put the object right after the verb.<br>- The usual structure for 把 sentences, as described above, puts the object right after 把. For certain verbs, however, you can have two objects in a 把 sentence. Their use in a 把 sentence will also involveprepositions.<br>- They use the following structure:<br>- Subj. + 把 + Obj. 1 + Verb + 给 + Obj. 2<br>- Common verbs that take two objects include: 送 (sòng), 拿 (ná), 递 (dì), 卖 (mài), 借 (jiè), 还 (huán), 介绍 (jièshào).<br><hr><br>- Because 把 sentences are all about 'doing stuff' to the object, andcomplementsin Mandarin often handle this issue, it's good to be aware of how these two grammar features interact.<br>- Result complementswork particularly well in 把 sentences. When you consider that both structures deal with the result or outcome of an action, this makes sense. The majority of result complements (except for perception verbs) fit in very well in a 把 construction. For example:<br><ruby>我把作业 做完了 。<rt>Wǒ bǎ zuòyè zuò wán le.</rt></ruby><br>I finished doing my homework.<br><ruby>老师把我 的 名字 读错了 。<rt>Lǎoshī bǎ wǒ de míngzì dú cuò le.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher read my name wrong.<br><hr><br>- Direction complementsalso work well in 把 constructions, for similar reasons. For example:<br><ruby>请把客人 带进去。<rt>Qǐng bǎ kèrén dài jìnqù.</rt></ruby><br>Please take the guests inside.<br><ruby>把我 的 眼镜 拿过来。<rt>Bǎ wǒ de yǎnjìng ná guòlái.</rt></ruby><br>Please bring my glasses over here.<br><hr><br>- Note thatpotential complementsdo not appear in 把 sentences. This is because they are hypothetical, whereas a 把 sentence must describe what actually happens.<br>- Since the basic structure has already been given above, we can jump right into some more exciting patterns!<br>- To negate a 把 sentence, insert 不要 or 别 (present or future) or 没有 (past) directly in front of 把. You can't put it after 把, 'inside' the 把 construction, as this would break the rule about describing what actually happened to the object. It would be like saying 'What happened to... was nothing.' It doesn't sound natural.<br><hr><br>- You can make 把 sentences into questions in the usual three ways to form questions in Mandarin:<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>你们把那个 问题解决 了 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen bǎ nàge wèntí jiějué le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you solve that problem?<br><ruby>你把我 手机放 在哪儿 了 ？<rt>Nǐ bǎ wǒ shǒujī fàng zài nǎr le?</rt></ruby><br>Where did you put my cell phone?<br><ruby>他把钱借 给 谁 了 ？<rt>Tā bǎ qián jiè gěi shéi le?</rt></ruby><br>Who did he lend the money to?<br><hr><br>- Be careful how you form questions with 把 sentences though. Remember that you have to have a definite object, and you have to describe what was done to that object. A question form could easily get in the way of one of these conditions.<br>- Adverbs can usually be placed before 把 or before the verb (the exception is negative adverbs, as described above). Adverbs in each of these positions can change the meaning in slightly different ways, as demonstrated with 都 in the examples below.<br><hr><br>- In the first sentence, 都 modifies 我们 to express 'we all finished the homework.' In the second sentence, 都 modifies 咖啡 to express 'he finished all the coffee'.<br>- As mentioned above, the object of a 把 sentence must be something specific and definite. This might involve nounmeasure words, which will come after the 把 and before the object.<br><hr><br>- Verb measure wordsare frequently used in 把 sentences and come at the end of a 把 sentence.<br><hr><br>- Note that in all of these sentences, the object is something specific and definite.<br>- If you're pretty clear on the explanations you've read so far and the examples make sense to you, you still need to put your knowledge to the test.<br>- Some verbs generally can't indicate what happenedtothe object. They only describe what the subject did. Below are some examples of verbs that do not generally work in 把 sentences.<br>- Psychological verbs: 爱 (ài) 'to love,' 喜欢 (xǐhuan) 'to like,' 想  (xiǎng) 'to miss,' 了解 (liǎojiě) 'to know well,' 害怕 (hàipà) 'to fear,' 恨 (hèn ) 'to hate.'<br>- Perception verbs: 看 (kàn) 'to look at,' 听 (tīng) 'to listen to,' 闻 (wén) 'to smell,' 像 (xiàng) 'to resemble.'<br>- It's important to note that 把 is a word with other uses. The most common is as ameasure wordfor things with handles, or things that you hold. Examples include 一把伞 ('an umbrella'), 一把枪 ('a gun'), and 一把椅子 ('a chair'). So, you've got to look at how 把 is being used in a sentence before you can understand its meaning.<br>- To demonstrate the difference, here's a sentence with both kinds of 把:<br><ruby>请 你把那把伞 拿 给 我 。<rt>Qǐng nǐ bǎ nà bǎ sǎn ná gěi wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>Please give me that umbrella.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG2UB2B		{}
Subj. + 被 + Doer + Verb Phrase<br>我被他骗 了 。		- Using 'bei' sentences<br>- 被 (bèi) sentences, which are called 被字句 (bèizìjù) in Chinese, are a key way to express thepassive voicein modern Mandarin Chinese.  In passive sentences, theobjectof an action becomes the subject of the sentence, and the 'doer' of the action, which would have been the subject of the normal (active voice) sentence, becomes secondary and may or may not be mentioned in the passive sentence.<br>- 被 (bèi) sentences are simply sentences which use apassiveverb and the word 被. 被 sentences are not the only way to create the passive verb form in Chinese, but they are the most common and definitely the type to tackle first.<br>- For the sake of clarity, take these sentences for example:<br>- First, passive sentences indicate that one has been negatively affected. For example:<br><ruby>他被打 了 。<rt>Tā bèi dǎ le.</rt></ruby><br>He was beaten.<br><hr><br>- Second, passive sentences shift emphasis from the 'doer' of the action to the one affected by that action. For example:<br><ruby>你被公司 炒鱿鱼 了 ？<rt>Nǐ bèi gōngsī chǎo yóuyú le?</rt></ruby><br>You got fired by the company?<br><hr><br>- Third, passive sentences allow one to avoid having to mention the 'doer' of the action, either because it is unknown, or for other reasons. For example:<br><ruby>我 的 手机被偷 了 。<rt>Wǒ de shǒujī bèi tōu le.</rt></ruby><br>My cell phone got stolen.<br><hr><br>- Normal use of 被 has a few preconditions:<br>- Subj. + 被 (+ Doer) + Verb + 了<br>- 被 sentences with a doer:<br><ruby>我被他骗了。<rt>Wǒ bèi tā piàn le.</rt></ruby><br>I was deceived by him.<br><ruby>他被警察抓了。<rt>Tā bèi jǐngchá zhuā le.</rt></ruby><br>He was caught by the police.<br><ruby>他被父母骂了。<rt>Tā bèi fùmǔ mà le.</rt></ruby><br>He was scolded by his parents.<br><hr><br>- 被 sentences without a doer:<br><ruby>我 的 车被撞了。<rt>Wǒ de chē bèi zhuàng le.</rt></ruby><br>My car was hit.<br><ruby>他们 做 的 坏事被发现了。<rt>Tāmen zuò de huàishì bèi fāxiàn le.</rt></ruby><br>The bad things they've done were discovered.<br><ruby>文件被删了。<rt>Wénjiàn bèi shān le.</rt></ruby><br>The files were deleted.<br><hr><br>- You know the basic pattern already, so it's time to go deeper...<br>- There's just one other complication. What if you want to make a sentence in thenegative? To negate a 被 sentence, you need to insert 没 or 没有 (past) directly in front of 被. For the present and future, use 不.<br><hr><br>- You can make 被 sentences into questions in the usual three ways to form questions in Mandarin:<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>那些 书被借走 了吗 ？<rt>Nàxiē shū bèi jiè zǒu le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have those books been borrowed?<br><ruby>他被谁 打的？<rt>Tā bèi shéi dǎ de?</rt></ruby><br>Who was he beaten by? <br><ruby>你 是不是被公司 炒鱿鱼了？<rt>Nǐ shì bu shì bèi gōngsī chǎo yóuyú le?</rt></ruby><br>Did you get fired by the company or not?<br><hr><br>- The particles 了 and 过 can both be used with 被 constructions, while 着 cannot. 着 indicates an action is 'ongoing,' which is not appropriate for a 被 construction, which should refer to an already complete action.<br><hr><br>- Bothresult complementsanddirection complementswork well in 被 sentences.<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>花瓶被摔碎了 。<rt>Huāpíng bèi shuāi suì le.</rt></ruby><br>The vase was broken into pieces.<br><ruby>那个人被车 撞死了 。<rt>Nàge rén bèi chē zhuàng sǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>That man got hit and killed by a car.<br><ruby>那个 男人被警察 赶出去了 。<rt>Nàge nánrén bèi jǐngchá gǎn chūqu le.</rt></ruby><br>The man was kicked out by the policeman.<br><hr><br>- Sorry if these example sentences all seem like downers, but 被 sentences tend to be negative (or even tragic!).<br>- What if you want to include adverbs in your 被 sentence?  Where should those go?  They go in the same place as thenegativeadverb 没有, above.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGHF9F1		{}
Place + Verb + 着 + Noun Phrase<br>桌子 上 放着一 本 书 。		- Alternative existential sentences<br>- Expressing something's existence in a certain place or location is not just limited to 在 (zài) and 有 (yǒu). The word order may be a little different from what you are used to, but 着 (zhe) and 是 (shì) are also ways to make everyday statements such as, 'There is a book lying on the desk.'<br>- Verbs that are paired with 着 are usuallystative verbs. So unlike withaction verbs, you're going to be describing an action that is kind of like just sitting there. It could be standing there, lying there, sitting there hanging there... the point is it isn't actively expending energydoinganything.<br>- Place + Verb + 着 + [Noun Phrase]<br><ruby>桌子 上 放着一 本 书 。<rt>Zhuōzi shàng fàng zhe yī běn shū .</rt></ruby><br>There is a book on the desk.<br><ruby>大厅 里 站着一些 警察 。<rt>Dàtīng lǐ zhàn zhe yīxiē jǐngchá.</rt></ruby><br>There are several policemen standing in the hall.<br><ruby>教室 里 坐着两 百 多 个 学生 。<rt>Jiàoshì lǐ zuò zhe liǎng bǎi duō gè xuéshēng.</rt></ruby><br>There are more than two hundred students sitting in the classroom.<br><hr><br>- Note that in English we sometimes use a verb in its '-ing' form, and sometimes use the passive '-ed' form of the verb.<br>- The subject in the 是 sentence pattern indicates the location or area. The object that comes after 是 is the only thing (worth mentioning) in that area. It's worth noting that there's no real time indication for most sentences like this. It could be setting a scene in a story (in the past), or it could be describing the current state of things (in the present).<br>- Place + 是 + [Noun Phrase]<br>- Note that 是 is used to describe a singular object existing somewhere, while 有 can refer to multiple objects/people.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGAC619		{}
想 + Question Word + 就 + Question Word<br>想去哪儿就去哪儿。		- Expressing 'as one likes' with 'jiu'<br>- When we want to express 'to do something as one pleases,' we can use the '想 (xiǎng)verb就 (jiù)verb' pattern.<br>- This structure is similar to how we would say in English, 'whatever I want to eat, I eat' or, 'wherever I want to go, I go.' The verb that comes after the 想 and the 就 are the same verb.<br>- 想 + Verb + 就 + Verb<br><ruby>想吃就吃 。<rt>Xiǎng chī jiù chī.</rt></ruby><br>If you want to eat, help yourself.<br><ruby>想走就走 吧 。<rt>Xiǎng zǒu jiù zǒu ba. </rt></ruby><br>Leave if you want to.<br><ruby>想买就买 ，不用 问 我 。<rt>Xiǎng mǎi jiù mǎi, bùyòng wèn wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>If you want to buy it, go ahead. You don't need to ask me.<br><hr><br>- You can also add in a question word, like 什么, 哪儿, or 怎么. When this is the case, the pronouns don't necessarily refer to anything specific. They can be seen more as words like 'whatever' or 'wherever.' This way, question pronouns (什么,谁,什么时候,etc) serve as 'indefinite references.'<br>- 想 + Verb + [Question Word] + 就 + Verb + [Question Word]<br><ruby>想去哪儿就去哪儿。<rt>Xiǎng qù nǎr jiù qù nǎr.</rt></ruby><br>You can go wherever you'd like to go.<br><ruby>想请谁就请谁。<rt>Xiǎng qǐng shéi jiù qǐng shéi.</rt></ruby><br>You can invite whoever you like.<br><ruby>想什么时候 来就什么时候来 。<rt>Xiǎng shénme shíhou lái jiù shénme shíhou lái.</rt></ruby><br>You can come whenever you like.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGDUZ55		{}
Subj. + 不是 + 不 / 没 + Predicate<br>我不是不知道 怎么 做 。		- Expressing 'double negation'<br>- There are two main methods for double negation. The simpler method is to use a double negative withmodal verbslike 会 or 能. The more complicated method is to negate both the subject and the predicate.<br>- This pattern just uses 不是 right before a negated predicate:<br>- Subj. + 不是 + 不 / 没 + Predicate<br>- This pattern uses modal verbs like 会, 能, or 可能, which are negated before a negated predicate:<br>- Subj. + 不 + 会 / 能 / 可能 + 不 / 没 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of either pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>他不会不来 的 。<rt>Tā bù huì bù lái  de.</rt></ruby><br>There is no way he's not coming.<br><ruby>她不可能不知道 。<rt>Tā bù kěnéng bù zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>There is no way she doesn't know about this.<br><ruby>她 太 害羞 了 ，不是不礼貌 。<rt>Tā tài hàixiū le, bù shì bù lǐmào.</rt></ruby><br>She's too shy; It's not that she's not polite.<br><hr><br>- This structure is used for saying things like 'not a single one,' often withtopic comments. 没有一个人 ('not a single person') is equivalent to 没有谁 ('not anyone').<br>- (Topic +) 没有 + [Singular Noun] + 不 / 没 + Predicate + 的<br><ruby>没有一 个 人不讨厌 他的。<rt>Méiyǒu yī gè rén bù tǎoyàn tā de.</rt></ruby><br>There is not one person who doesn't dislike him.<br><ruby>这些 菜没有一 个不辣的。<rt>Zhèxiē cài méiyǒu yī gè bù là de.</rt></ruby><br>There is no single one that is not spicy among these dishes.<br><ruby>我们 公司 的 员工没有一 个不会 说 英语的。<rt>Wǒmen gōngsī de yuángōng méiyǒu yī gè bù huì shuō Yīngyǔ de.</rt></ruby><br>Our company doesn't have a single employee who can't speak English.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEEA2D		{}
连 + Subj. + 都 (+ 不 / 没) + Verb<br>你连小狗都怕 ？		- Expressing 'even' with 'lian' and 'dou'<br>- 连⋯⋯都⋯⋯ (lián... dōu...) is used similarly to how 'even' is used in English and can emphasize certain surprising pieces of information. The tricky part about using it is that you have to remember to usebothparts of the pattern (rather than just throwing in one word, like 'even' in English).<br>- 连 + Subj. + 都 (+ 不 / 没) + Verb<br>- Sometimes 也 (yě) is used instead of 都 (dōu), and the two are interchangeable for this pattern, but 都 is more commonly used with 连 (lián), so it's the one we'll use exclusively here.<br><ruby>这个 问题 太 简单 了 ，连三岁 小孩都知道 。<rt>Zhège wèntí tài jiǎndān le, lián sān suì xiǎohái dōu zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>This question is so easy that even a three-year-old kid knows the answer.<br><ruby>这个 汉字 太 难 了 ，连我 的 中文 老师都不认识 。<rt>Zhège Hànzì tài nán le, lián wǒ de Zhōngwén lǎoshī dōubù rènshi.</rt></ruby><br>This Chinese character is so difficult that even my Chinese teacher doesn't know it.<br><ruby>他 很可怜 ，连他 妈妈都不管 他 。<rt>Tā hěn kělián, lián tā māma dōu bù  guǎn tā.</rt></ruby><br>The poor child. Even his mother doesn't care about him.<br><hr><br>- Note that 都 can't be omitted in any of these sentences. You really needboth parts of the pattern.<br><hr><br>- Note that for this pattern, the object moves to the front of the sentence instead of coming after the verb as it normally does. After you move the object to the front of the sentence, you can use 连 before the object and 都 before the verb or verb phrase.<br>- 连 + Obj. + 都 (+ 不 / 没) + Verb<br><ruby>他 什么 都 吃，连狗肉都吃 。<rt>Tā shénme dōu chī, lián gǒu ròu dōu chī.</rt></ruby><br>He eats everything, even dog meat.<br><ruby>你连你 最好 的 朋友都不相信 ？<rt>Nǐ lián nǐ zuìhǎo de péngyou dōu bù xiāngxìn?</rt></ruby><br>You don't even trust your best friend?<br><ruby>你连麦当劳都吃 不起 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ lián Màidāngláo dōu chī bu qǐ ma?</rt></ruby><br>You can't even afford a meal at McDonald's?<br><hr><br>- If the object the comes after 连 is a whole sentence, there must be a specificinterrogative pronoun(a 'question word') in the sentence.<br><ruby>你连她 叫什么都没问 ？<rt>Nǐ lián tā jiào shénme dōu méi wèn?</rt></ruby><br>You didn't even ask what her name is? <br><ruby>你 怎么了 ？连你 住在 哪儿都不记得 了 ？<rt>Nǐ zěnme le?

And the truth is that youcanget away with not actively using it for a pretty long time. Eventually you'll get more comfortable with it, but it probably won't come as naturally as some other patterns.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGNP0WV		{}
每次 + Event 1 + 都 + Event 2<br>为什么每次 我 来 他都不 在。		- Expressing 'every time' with 'mei' and 'dou'<br>- 每次⋯⋯ 都⋯⋯ (měi cì... dōu...) is a pattern used to express 'every time.' Translating from English, you might feel that the only part really needed is 每次 (měi cì), since it literally means 'every time.' This is incorrect! Not only isthe adverb 都 (dōu)required, but it's arguably more vital than the 每次 (měi cì)! So it's important to get used to using both parts.<br>- This pattern actually builds on thebasic 每……都…… pattern, which you should already know. In this grammar structure, we go beyond just saying things like 'every person' or 'every day,' and focus on what happensevery timea certain action is done.<br>- 每次 + Event 1 + 都 + Event 2<br><ruby>她每次来 我 家都带 花 。<rt>Tā měi cì lái wǒ jiā dōu dài huā.</rt></ruby><br>She brings flowers every time she visits me.<br><ruby>为什么每次我 来 他都不 在 ？<rt>Wèishénme měi cì wǒ lái tā dōu bù zài?</rt></ruby><br>How come he's not here every time I come?<br><ruby>我每次玩 这个 游戏都输 。<rt>Wǒ měi cì wán zhège yóuxì dōu shū.</rt></ruby><br>Every time I play this game, I lose.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGXHQEF		{}
Question Word + 都 + Predicate<br>谁都可以 进 。		- Expressing 'every' with question words<br>- This grammar point is not about how to use每 (měi) to mean 'every,'but rather how to combinequestion wordswith都(dōu) to make words and phrases like 'everywhere' or 'everyone.' You may have learned this same pattern forexpressing 'everything,'but now it's time to extend it.<br>- 谁 都 (shéi dōu) is a pattern used to express 'everyone' (or possibly 'anyone') in Chinese. The placement of the question word 谁 is very similar to the way什么 (shénme) can be used to express 'every', along with other question words like 哪儿 (nǎr) and 多少 (duōshao).<br>- 谁 + 都 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>谁都喜欢 美食 。<rt>Shéi dōu xǐhuan měishí.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone likes delicious food.<br><ruby>谁都可以 进 。<rt>Shéi dōu kěyǐ jìn.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone can come in.<br><ruby>谁都不 相信 他 说 的 话 。<rt>Shéi dōu bù xiāngxìn tā shuō de huà.</rt></ruby><br>No one believes what he said.<br><hr><br>- This pattern works with both 哪儿 (nǎr) and 哪里 (nǎlǐ).<br>- 哪儿 / 哪里 (+ Verb) + 都 + Predicate<br><ruby>他 的 房间 里哪儿都是 脏 衣服 。<rt>Tā de fángjiān lǐ nǎr dōu shì zāng yīfu.</rt></ruby><br>His dirty laundry is all over his room.<br><ruby>我 太 累 了，哪儿都不 想 去 。<rt>Wǒ tài lèi le, nǎr dōu bù xiǎng qù.</rt></ruby><br>I'm too tired.

Subj. + 多长时间 + Verb + 一次 (+ Obj.)<br>你多长时间剪一 次头发 ？		- Expressing 'how often'<br>- Asking 'how often' is one of those things that seems so simple in English but relatively complicated in Chinese. The way to ask in Chinese is, literally, 'how long of a time' (do something) 'one time.' So you'll need the phrases 多长时间 (duō cháng shíjiān) and 一次 (yī cì).<br>- In English you let the person answering the question decide both the length of time and how many times an action is done within that timeframe. So if you ask 'how often,' you might get an answer like 'twice a week.' But in Chinese, the frequency is fixed at 'once' as part of the question. That actually won't stop people from answering 'twice a week' in Chinese, though; it's just how the question is normally phrased in Chinese.<br>- Subj. + 多长时间 + Verb + 一次 (+ Obj.)<br><hr><br>- Subj. + [Length of Time]  + Verb + Times (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>我一 周给 妈妈 打两 次电话 。<rt>Wǒ yī zhōu gěi māma dǎ liǎng cì diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>I give mom a call twice a week.<br><ruby>我们 公司一 周开一 次会 。<rt>Wǒmen gōngsī yī zhōu kāi yī cì huì.</rt></ruby><br>Our company holds one meeting per week.<br><ruby>我两 个 月剪一 次头发 。<rt>Wǒ liǎng gè yuè jiǎn yī cì tóufa.</rt></ruby><br>I cut my hair every two months.<br><hr><br>- The thing about using the pattern above is that it's expected that the activity is doneregularly, as part of ahabit.  If it's not an activity that's regularly engaged in, it's weird to use the pattern.  Consider the following examples:<br><hr><br>- In these cases, the speaker is trying to get any idea of how often the other person does something, regardless of how regular or habitual it is.  In this case, just use 经常 (or similar) to ask about it.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCED31		{}
Subj. + 越来越 + Adj. + 了<br>天气越来越冷 了。		- Expressing 'more and more' with 'yuelaiyue'<br>- 越来越 (yuèláiyuè) is used frequently in Chinese to express that some quality or state is increasing with time and is often translated into English as 'more and more.' This is the simple form of this pattern, which uses 来, but there is also amore complex one (which uses two different adjectives/verbs).<br>- This structure expresses that something is becoming more and moreadjectiveover time, with the latter adjective changing with the verb. The most common structure is:<br>- Subj. + 越来越 + Adj. + 了<br><ruby>天气越来越冷了。<rt>Tiānqì yuèláiyuè lěng le.</rt></ruby><br>The weather is getting colder and colder.<br><ruby>你 女儿越来越漂亮了。<rt>Nǐ nǚér yuèláiyuè piàoliang le.</rt></ruby><br>Your daughter is getting more and more beautiful.<br><ruby>你 说 得越来越好了。<rt>Nǐ shuō de yuèláiyuè hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>You speak better and better.<br><hr><br>- Subj. + 越来越 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>我越来越喜欢 上海了。<rt>Wǒ yuèláiyuè xǐhuan Shànghǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>I like Shanghai more and more.<br><ruby>你越来越了解 我了。<rt>Nǐ yuèláiyuè liǎojiě wǒ le.</rt></ruby><br>You know me better and better.<br><ruby>我越来越理解 我 的 父母了。<rt>Wǒ yuèláiyuè lǐjiě wǒ de fùmǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>I understand my parents more and more.<br><hr><br>- When the verb is negative in Chinese, a translation like 'less and less' with a positive verb might be more appropriate in English than sticking with a 'more and more' translation. The Chinese pattern doesn't change, though.<br><ruby>我越来越不相信 他了。<rt>Wǒ yuèláiyuè bù xiāngxìn tā le.</rt></ruby><br>I believe him less and less.<br><ruby>你越来越不懂 我了。<rt>Nǐ yuèláiyuè bù dǒng wǒ le.</rt></ruby><br>You understand me less and less.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG7UE4H		{}
Noun 1 + 是 + Noun 2 + 的 + Number + 倍<br>他 现在 的 工资是两 年 前 的 三倍。		- Expressing 'multiples' with 'bei'<br>- The word 倍 (bèi) is used to express the idea of multiples, as in '3timesas many' or '5timesmore.' Its usage can be a little tricky (different from English), so pay close attention to the pattern below.<br>- For this pattern, we're statinghow many times moreamount A is compared to amount B. Pretty straightforward.<br>- A + 是 + B + 的 + Number + 倍<br><ruby>他 现在 的 工资是两 年 前 的 四倍。<rt>Tā xiànzài de gōngzī shì liǎng nián qián de sì bèi.</rt></ruby><br>His current salary is four times what it was two years ago.<br><ruby>公司 现在 的 规模是十 年 前 的 五倍。<rt>Gōngsī xiànzài de guīmó shì shí nián qián de wǔ  bèi.</rt></ruby><br>The company's current scope is five times what it was 10 years ago.<br><ruby>今年 的 产量是去年 的 两倍。<rt>Jīnnián de chǎnliàng shì qùnián de liǎng bèi.</rt></ruby><br>This year's output is twice as much as last year's.<br><hr><br>- This pattern involves an adjective, one of the most common being 多 ('many'). You'll see other adjectives related to quantity appearing in this pattern as well, such as 大 ('big'), 贵 ('expensive'), 高 ('tall'), 长 ('long'), etc. In Chinese, it is not common to use the 'negative opposite' adjectives in these kinds of comparisons, so you won't normally see the words for 'small,' 'cheap,' 'short,' etc. appearing in this pattern.<br>- A + 比 + B + Adj. + Number + 倍<br>- One very important linguistic difference between English and Chinese to note here is that in Chinese, you're typically talking about how many multiplesin additionto the original amount. So 多一倍 is 'x + 1x,' in other words 'double' the original amount. Naturally, 多两倍 would betriplethe original amount (x + 2x). This little detail is sometimes confusing even for native speakers, so if you're talking about multiples and 多 is involved, be sure to use actual numbers to confirm both sides are on the same page!<br><ruby>我 家 客厅比你 家 客厅大一倍。<rt>Wǒ jiā kètīng bǐ nǐ jiā kètīng dà yī bèi.</rt></ruby><br>My home's living room is double the size of your home's living room.<br><ruby>这个 15 岁 的 男孩比一般 的 孩子重一倍。<rt>Zhège shíwǔ suì de nánhái bǐ yībān de háizi zhòng yī bèi.</rt></ruby><br>This fifteen-year-old kid weighs double what a normal kid at his age should weigh.<br><ruby>你 的 速度比我们快两倍。<rt>Nǐ de sùdù bǐ wǒmen kuài liǎng bèi.</rt></ruby><br>Your speed is three times as fast as our speed.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG7D4EC		{}
Subj. + 一点 + 也 / 都 + 不 + Adj.<br>你一点 也 不胖 。		- Expressing 'not at all' with 'yidianr ye bu'<br>- Sometimes we may want to say something is 'not even the least bit [adjective].' For example, we might say in English: 'I am not at all hungry.'  In Chinese, we can use 一点(儿)也不 (yīdiǎnr yě bù) or 一点(儿)都不 (yīdiǎnr dōu bù) to express 'not at all [adjective].'<br>- The phrases 一点(儿)也不 and 一点(儿)都不 can both be used to express 'not at all.'<br>- Subj. + 一点(儿) + 也 / 都 + 不 + Adj.<br><ruby>那个 问题一点儿 也 不难 。<rt>Nàge wèntí yīdiǎnr yě bù nán.</rt></ruby><br>That question isn't difficult at all.<br><ruby>这个 菜一点 都 不好吃 。<rt>Zhège cài yīdiǎn dōu bù hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>This dish isn't tasty at all.<br><ruby>我 同事一点 都 不幽默 。<rt>Wǒ tóngshì yīdiǎn dōu bù yōumò.</rt></ruby><br>My colleague is not humorous at all.<br><hr><br>- This describes the subject as being 'not at alladjective' or 'not even slightlyadjective.'Psychological verbscan also appear in place of the adjective in this structure.<br>- Subj. + 一点 + 也 / 都 + 不 + [Verb Phrase]<br>- If the verb has an object, it sometimes gets moved to the front of the sentence.<br><ruby>我一点 也 不喜欢 奶酪 。<rt>Wǒ yīdiǎn yě bù xǐhuan nǎilào.</rt></ruby><br>I don't like cheese at all.<br><ruby>你一点 也 不会 说 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ yīdiǎn yě bù huì shuō ma?</rt></ruby><br>You can't speak at all?<br><ruby>她一点 都 不知道 这 件 事 。<rt>Tā yīdiǎn dōu bù zhīdào zhè jiàn shì.</rt></ruby><br>She doesn't know about this at all.<br><hr><br>- The phrases '一点也没 ' and '一点都没 ' can also be used to express 'not at all .'

Subj. + 不知道 + Verb Phrase + 好<br>我 真的不 知道怎么办才好。		- Expressing not knowing how to do something using 'hao'<br>- 不知道⋯⋯好 (bù zhīdào... hǎo) is an expression used to indicate and emphasize that the speaker does not know how to do something or at least does not know how to do something well.<br>- Subj. + 不知道 + [Verb Phrase] + 好<br>- This verb phrase usually includes a question word, like 什么, 谁, 怎么, 哪个, 哪里, 什么时候, etc.<br>- You will sometimes see the adverb 才 preceding the 好, which serves the purpose of emphasis.<br><ruby>我 真的不 知道怎么办才好。<rt>Wǒ zhēnde bù zhīdào zěnme bàn cái hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I really don't know what to do about this .<br><ruby>我们 都不 知道说什么好。<rt>Wǒmen dōu bù zhīdào shuō shénme hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>None of us knew what to say.<br><ruby>这 件 事 我不 知道跟谁说好。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì wǒ bù zhīdào gēn shéi shuō hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I'm not sure who to talk to about this matter.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG0EQQJ		{}
为了 + Purpose + Verb<br>为了钱 ，他 什么 都 愿意 做 。		- Expressing purpose with 'weile'<br>- 为了 (wèile) is most often used to indicate the purpose of an action or the person that will benefit from some act of kindness.  In the 'purpose' sense, it almost exactly corresponds to 'in order to' or 'for the purpose of' in English.<br>- When 为了 indicates the purpose of an action, it's usually acting as apreposition.  In this role, thewhole'为了 phrase' should comebeforethe verb.<br>- 为了 ⋯⋯ ，Subj. ⋯⋯<br>- Note also that 为了 is a single word; the 了 here is not serving its role as a particle in this case.<br><ruby>为了钱 ，他 什么 都 愿意 做 。<rt>Wèile qián, tā shénme dōu yuànyì zuò.</rt></ruby><br>He's willing to do anything for money.<br><ruby>为了孩子 的 未来 ，他 决定 搬到 上海 。<rt>Wèile háizi de wèilái, tā juédìng bāndào Shànghǎi.</rt></ruby><br>He decided to move to Shanghai for his children's future.<br><ruby>为了这个 面试 ，他 买 了 一 套 很 贵 的 西服 。<rt>Wèile zhège miànshì, tā mǎi le yī tào hěn guì de xīfú.</rt></ruby><br>He bought a very expensive suit for this job interview.<br><hr><br>- Sometimes you will see 为了 following 是. In this case, 为了 mean 'for.' Note that 为了 and 因为 both have the character 为 in them, and they have sort of similar meanings. You will also see 因为 following 是, instead of 为了. It literally means 'is because (of).'<br>- ⋯⋯ 是 + 为了 / 因为 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>我 这么 做是 为了帮 你 。<rt>Wǒ zhème zuò shì wèile bāng nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I did all this to help you.<br><ruby>他 做 兼职是 为了多 赚 点 钱 。<rt>Tā zuò jiānzhí shì wèile duō zhuàn diǎn qián.</rt></ruby><br>The reason why he has a part time job is to make a little more money.<br><ruby>你 学 中文是 因为你 的 中国 女朋友 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ xué Zhōngwén shì yīnwèi nǐde Zhōngguó nǚpéngyou ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you studying Chinese because of your Chinese girlfriend?<br><hr><br>- Note that之所以is a more difficult pattern, which means 'the reason why' in a more formal way.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQGJXT		{}
在哪儿 / 谁 / 什么 / 什么时候<br>这个 人 我在 哪儿见 过 。		- Expressing 'some' with question words<br>- Chinesequestion wordscan play a double role. As we know, they are used in questions, but they can also mean 'some.' The 'some' we refer to is the vague, undefined 'some,' as in 'somewhere,' 'someone,' 'something,' or 'sometime.'<br>- This one is often used withVerb + 过.<br>- Examples:<br><ruby>这个 人 我 在哪儿见 过 。<rt>Zhège rén wǒ zài nǎr jiàn guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've met this person somewhere before.<br><ruby>这 首 歌 我 在哪儿听 过 。<rt>Zhè shǒu gē wǒ zài nǎr tīng guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've heard this song somewhere.<br><ruby>这 篇 文章 我们 在哪儿看 过 。<rt>Zhè piān wénzhāng wǒmen zài nǎr kàn guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've read this article somewhere before.<br><hr><br>- Examples:<br><ruby>你 让谁来 帮 我 一下 。<rt>Nǐ ràng shéi lái bāng wǒ yīxià.</rt></ruby><br>Ask someone to help me with this.<br><ruby>这 件 事 我 听谁说 过 。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì wǒ tīng shéi shuō guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've heard somebody talk about this before.<br><ruby>你 找谁带 你 进去 吧 。<rt>Nǐ zhǎo shéi dài nǐ jìnqù ba.</rt></ruby><br>You should find someone to take you inside.<br><hr><br>- This one is often used with点(儿) before the verb.<br>- Examples:<br><ruby>我们 应该 做 点儿什么。<rt>Wǒmen yīnggāi zuò diǎnr shénme.</rt></ruby><br>We should do something.<br><ruby>老大 ，你 不 说 点儿什么？<rt>Lǎodà, nǐ bù shuō diǎnr shénme?</rt></ruby><br>Boss, aren't you going to say something?<br><ruby>我 想 喝 点儿什么。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng hē diǎnr shénme.</rt></ruby><br>I want to drink something.<br><hr><br>- Careful with this one! If you're not paying attention, you might think that it's a question asking 'when,' but in reality it might just be polite noise. If the lack of question intonation isn't enough, the 吧 on the end is also a clue that these sentences aren't actually questions.<br>- Examples:<br><ruby>什么 时候我们 见面 谈 吧 。<rt>Shénme shíhou wǒmen jiànmiàn tán ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's meet and talk about this sometime.<br><ruby>什么 时候来 我 新 家 玩 吧 。<rt>Shénme shíhou lái wǒ xīn jiā wán ba.</rt></ruby><br>You should come to my new house to hangout sometime.<br><ruby>我们什么 时候去 看看 他 吧 。<rt>Wǒmen shénme shíhou qù kànkan tā ba.</rt></ruby><br>Let's pay him a visit sometime.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG7ED89		{}
对 + Person + 来说 / 一般 来说<br>一般 来说，私立 学校 都 比较 贵 。		- Phrases using 'laishuo'<br>- Although the different phrases involving 来说 (láishuō) may seem pretty different, they do share a common structure: a word or short phrase at the beginning of a sentence, followed by 来说, sets the speaker's attitude or point of view before launching into the full comment.<br>- In English we say 'to someone' or 'for someone,' followed by some information about their particular view or circumstances.

Noun 1 有 Noun 2 + Adj. + 吗？<br>他有我 帅 吗 ？		- Expressing comparable degree with 'you'<br>- 有(yǒu), besides just meaning 'tohave,' can also be used in comparisons. It's what you use instead of比(bǐ) if something is 'as [Adj.] as' something else.<br>- The structure literally means, 'A has B's [Adj.].' The meaning is 'A is as [Adj.] as B.' This pattern is often used in questions. Think of the jealous girl asking, 'is she as pretty as me?' or the insecure weightlifter bro asking, 'is he as jacked as me?' Note that for this kind of question, B is usually the one that the speaker prefers.<br>- A + 有 + B + Adj. + 吗 ？<br>- This comparison pattern is generally only used in questions, not statements.<br><ruby>他有我 帅 吗 ？<rt>Tā yǒu wǒ shuài ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is he as handsome as me?<br><ruby>你有老板 忙 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ yǒu lǎobǎn máng ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you as busy as the boss?<br><ruby>他有姚明 高 吗 ？<rt>Tā yǒu Yáo Míng gāo ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is he as tall as YaoMing?<br><hr><br>- If a verb is included in this pattern to talk about an action, it's probably going to involve adegree complementusing this structure below:<br>- A + 有 + B + Verb + 得 + Adj. + 吗 ？<br><ruby>他有我 做得好 吗 ？<rt>Tā yǒu wǒ zuò de hǎo ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can he do it as well as I do?<br><ruby>你有Bolt 跑得快 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ yǒu Bolt pǎo de kuài ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you run as fast as Bolt does?<br><hr><br>- This form is often used with 这么 or 那么, which in this case means 'as much.' And it indicates that B is already very [Adj.].

跟 + Noun 1 + 比 (起来) ，Noun 2⋯⋯<br>跟上海比，北京 的 冬天 比较 干 。		- Expressing 'compared with' using 'gen'<br>- If you want to do a straight-up comparison statement, go ahead and use theclassic 比 (bǐ) structure. But if you want to lead with a 'compared with...' phrase, you'll need a 跟 (gēn) and a slightly different word order.<br>- This sentence structure is used for comparing one thingas it relates toanother.<br>- These patterns are for making a comment about B,as it relates toA.<br>- 跟 + A + 比 (起来) ，B⋯⋯<br>- B can also come at the beginning of the sentence:<br>- B + 跟 + A + 比 (起来) ，⋯⋯<br>- For both of these structures, you could swap out 跟 (gēn) for和(hé) with no real difference, but using 跟 (gēn) is slightly more common.<br><ruby>跟上海比，我 老家 的 物价 很 低 。<rt>Gēn Shànghǎi bǐ, wǒ lǎojiā de wùjià hěn dī.</rt></ruby><br>Compared to Shanghai, prices in my hometown are very low.<br><ruby>跟东部比，我 更 喜欢 美国 西部 。<rt>Gēn dōngbù bǐ, wǒ gèng xǐhuan Měiguó xībù.</rt></ruby><br>Compared to the eastern USA, I like the western USA more.<br><ruby>跟他比，你 最大 的 优势 是 什么 ？<rt>Gēn tā bǐ, nǐ zuì dà de yōushì shì shénme?</rt></ruby><br>Compared to him, what is your biggest advantage?<br><hr><br>- 比 (bǐ) can also be used for comparing one subject over two different time periods.<br>- 跟 + Time + 比 (起来) ，⋯⋯<br>- Again, you could use 和 (hé) instead of 跟 (gēn) here, but using 跟 (gēn) is more common.<br><ruby>跟去年比，你 的 中文 进步 了 很多 。<rt>Gēn qùnián bǐ, nǐ de Zhōngwén jìnbù le hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>Compared to last year, your Chinese has improved a lot.<br><ruby>跟十 年 前比 起来，中国人 的 生活 水平 提高 了 很多 。<rt>Gēn shí nián qián bǐ qǐlái, Zhōngguó rén de shēnghuó shuǐpíng tígāo le hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>Compared to ten years ago, the standard of living for Chinese people has gotten much better.<br><ruby>跟上个 月比，这 个 月 的 工作 很 轻松。<rt>Gēn shàngge yuè bǐ, zhège yuè de gōngzuò hěn qīngsōng.</rt></ruby><br>Compared with last month, this month our work is a lot more relaxed.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG920B7		{}
Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + 更 / 还 + Adj.<br>他比姚明还高 。		- Expressing 'even more' with 'geng' or 'hai'<br>- When used in a comparison, 更 (gèng) or 还 (hái) can kick up an adjective to an even higher degree. For example, New York City is America's biggest city with a population of around 9 million. Shanghai is China's biggest city, with a population of more than 20 million. So even though NYC's population is big, Shanghai's is even bigger. You'd use 更 or 还 to express this in Chinese.<br>- Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + 更 / 还 + Adj.<br>- 还 has a more intense tone, and it usually carries a tone of surprise and skepticism. Therefore, using the form of a rhetorical question with 还 can be understood as 'how can it be?'<br>- Also note that 更 can be used with 了 in this pattern, indicating change of situation or state, while 还 can't  be used in this way.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG64E96		{}
Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + Adj. + 多了<br>拼音比汉字 容易多了。		- Expressing 'much more' in comparisons<br>- If you want to up the contrast of your comparisons, you might want to express 'much more.' You can do this using 多 (duō), but did you know there are actually three different ways to do it?<br>- As well as expressing that two things differ, you might want to go further and say that they differa lotby adding 很多 (hěn duō), 多了(duō le), or 得多 (de duō). This is like saying that one thing ismuch more Adj.than another in English.<br>- Noun 1 + 比 + Noun 2 + Adj. + 很多 / 得多 / 多了<br><ruby>拼音比汉字 容易很多。<rt>Pīnyīn bǐ Hànzì róngyì hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>Pinyin is much easier than Chinese characters.<br><ruby>坐 高铁比坐 飞机 方便很多。<rt>Zuò gāotiě bǐ zuò fēijī fāngbiàn hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>It's much more convenient to take the high-speed train than the airplane.<br><ruby>这 个 女老师比那个 男老师 严格得 多。<rt>Zhège nǚ lǎoshī bǐ nàge nán lǎoshī yángé de duō.</rt></ruby><br>This female teacher is much stricter than that male teacher.<br><hr><br>- Given sufficient context, it's possible to use 多了 without the full comparison pattern. 多了 is the only one of the three 'much more' phrases introduced in this article which can be used this way.<br>- Subj. + Adj. + 多了<br>- A few examples:	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6KUS5		{}
Adj. + 是 + Adj.， 但是⋯⋯<br>这个 东西 好是好 ，就是太 贵 了 。		- Conceding a point with 'shi'<br>- When conceding a point, we often put emphasis on the point we are conceding, and in Chinese, there is a way to do that with 是 (shì).<br>- This pattern is often used in an argument or debate. It's usually indicating that the speaker is conceding a point,butthey still have some reservations about the topic at hand. Don't worry, the examples will make this clear.<br>- Adj. + 是 + Adj. ， 但是 / 就是 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>工作 忙是忙 ，但是我 很 开心 。<rt>Gōngzuò máng  shì máng, dànshì wǒ hěn kāixīn.</rt></ruby><br>Work may be busy, but I'm very happy.<br><ruby>这 件 衣服 好看是好看 ，但是不 适合 我 。<rt>Zhè jiàn yīfu  hǎokàn shì hǎokàn, dànshì bù shìhé wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>This piece of clothing may look nice, but it doesn't suit me.<br><ruby>这里 的 环境 好是好 ，但是交通 不太 方便 。<rt>Zhèlǐ de huánjìng hǎo shì hǎo, dànshì jiāotōng bù tài fāngbiàn.</rt></ruby><br>This environment may be nice, but transportation is not very convenient.<br><hr><br>- When using 但是, the second clause can express positive experiences or something good, as well as negative perspectives. However, when leading with 就是, the second clause needs to express something negative.<br><ruby>好吃是好吃 ，就是不 太 健康 。<rt>Hǎochī shì hǎochī, jiùshì bù tài jiànkāng.</rt></ruby><br>It may be tasty, it's just that it's not very healthy.<br><ruby>这个 东西 好是好 ，就是太 贵 了 。<rt>Zhège dōngxi hǎo shì hǎo, jiùshì tài guì le.</rt></ruby><br>This thing may be good, it's just that it's too expensive.<br><ruby>这个 学生  聪明是聪明 ，就是不 太 努力 。<rt>Zhège xuéshēng  cōngming shì cōngming, jiùshì bù tài nǔlì.</rt></ruby><br>This student may be smart, it's just that he's not very hard-working.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGT9Y8P		{}
Subj. + 一 + Event 1，就 + Event 2<br>他一到 家 ，就去 洗澡  了 。		- Events in quick succession with 'yi... jiu...'<br>- This pattern tells us thatas soon asone thing happens, thenanother thing happensimmediately afterwards. You mark the two events with 一 (yī)  and 就 (jiù).<br>- The pattern involves two different events, the first preceded by '一,' and then the second event, which follows in quick succession, preceded by 就.<br>- 一 + Event 1，就 + Event 2<br>- The subjects of the two 'Events' can be the same, but they don't have to be. If they're the same, then you don't need to repeat the subject for the second one.<br><ruby>饿 死了，我一下课就要 去 吃 午饭 。<rt>È sǐ le, wǒ yī xiàkè jiù yào qù chī wǔfàn.</rt></ruby><br>I'm starving.

虽然⋯⋯ ，但是 / 可是⋯⋯<br>虽然渴 了，但是不 想 喝 啤酒。		- Expressing 'although' with 'suiran' and 'danshi'<br>- The grammar pattern 虽然⋯⋯ 但是⋯⋯ (suīrán... dànshì...) is one of the most commonly used patterns in Chinese, especially in written Chinese. You can think of it as meaning 'although,' but unlike in English, you still need to follow it up with a 'but' word in Chinese.<br>- 虽然⋯⋯ 但是⋯⋯ expresses that while the former part of the sentence is true, there is an adverse reaction in the latter part.<br>- 虽然 ⋯⋯ ，但是 / 可是 ⋯⋯<br>- Simply put, the pattern means,although..., but...In English, you wouldn't normally need the 'but' there, but it is required in Chinese. Be aware that 可是 can be used interchangeably with 但是 for the 'but' part. Also note that 还是 can be used after 但是 for emphasis, meaning 'still.'<br><ruby>虽然外面 很 冷 ，可是里面 很 暖和 。<rt>Suīrán wàimiàn hěn lěng, kěshì lǐmiàn hěn nuǎnhuo.</rt></ruby><br>Although it's cold outside, it's warm inside.<br><ruby>这 件 衣服虽然有点 贵 ，但是质量 很 好 。<rt>Zhè jiàn yīfu suīrán yǒudiǎn guì, dànshì zhìliàng hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>Although this piece of clothing is a little expensive, the quality is good.<br><ruby>他虽然不 想 去 ，但是还是去 了 。<rt>Tā suīrán bù xiǎng qù, dànshì háishì qù le.</rt></ruby><br>Although he didn't want to go, he ended up going.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGXI560		{}
要么⋯⋯，要么⋯⋯<br>要么你 去，要么他 去 。		- Expressing 'either... or...' with 'yaome'<br>- 要么 (yàome) is used for offering a pair of choices with a hardline 'either/or' feel:these are the two choices. Choose one.(It can also be used for more than two choices, but it's usually just two.)<br>- You can give a series of alternatives by using 要么 (yàome). The structure is pretty versatile, as you can put a wide variety of things after each 要么. It can be used both for commands and non-commands.<br>- 要么 + Option A ，要么 + Option B<br><ruby>要么你 去，要么他 去 。<rt>Yàome nǐ qù, yàome tā qù.</rt></ruby><br>Either you go, or he goes.<br><ruby>要么继续 ，要么放弃 。<rt>Yàome jìxù, yàome fàngqì.</rt></ruby><br>Either keep going or give up.<br><ruby>要么好好 做 ，要么就 别 做 。<rt>Yàome hǎohāo zuò, yàome jiù bié zuò.</rt></ruby><br>You either do it well or don't do it.<br><hr><br>- This 'either/or' 要么 pattern is similar to one of the uses of each要不and或者.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG30A60		{}
除了 ⋯⋯ (+ 以外) ，Subj. + 都 / 也 / 还 ⋯⋯<br>除了他 ，我们都去 过 。		- Expressing 'except' and 'in addition' with 'chule… yiwai'<br>- Using 除了 (chúle)--often with 以外 (yǐwài)--will help you spruce up your sentences when you want to express the meanings of 'except,' 'besides,' or 'in addition.'

如果⋯⋯ (的话) ，(就) ⋯⋯<br>如果明天 下雨的话，我们就不 去 了 。		- Expressing 'if' with 'ruguo... dehua'<br>- 如果⋯⋯的话 (rúguǒ... dehuà) is a pattern commonly used in Chinese to express 'if.' An easy way to remember the pattern's format is that in the full form, the condition is 'sandwiched' between 如果 and 的话.<br>- 如果 ⋯⋯ 的话 ，(就) ⋯⋯<br>- Note that 就 (jiù) is often optional.

Reason ，怪不得 / 难怪 + Observation<br>小张 请假 了，难怪今天 没有 看到 他。		- Expressing 'no wonder'<br>- 怪不得 (guàibude) can be used to express that the speaker finds something unsurprising. It can be used alone or in a variety of different structures, as shown below. 难怪 (nánguài) is another way to express the exact same thing.<br>- 怪不得 is used to convey the speaker's newfound understanding of a situation, having recently acquired some new information that, in his opinion, explains it.<br>- Reason ，怪不得 / 难怪 + [Observation]<br>- 怪不得 can be replaced with 难怪 in the structure without altering its meaning.<br><ruby>小张 请假 了，怪不得今天 没有 看到 他 。<rt>Xiǎo Zhāng qǐngjià le, guàibude jīntiān méiyǒu kàndào tā.</rt></ruby><br>Little Zhang asked for vacation time, no wonder I haven't seen him today.<br><ruby>天天 迟到 ，怪不得他 被 炒鱿鱼 了 。<rt>Tiāntiān chídào, guàibude tā bèi chǎoyóuyú le.</rt></ruby><br>He's late for work every day. No wonder he got fired.<br><ruby>她 是 你 妹妹 ？难怪你们 长 得 这么 像 。<rt>Tā shì nǐ mèimei? Nánguài nǐmen cháng de zhème xiàng.</rt></ruby><br>She's your younger sister? No wonder you two look so much alike.<br><hr><br>- 怪不得 / 难怪 + [Observation] ，原来 (+ 是) + Reason<br><ruby>难怪学生 都 不 喜欢 这个 老师 ，原来他 的 作业 太 多 了 。<rt>Nánguài xuéshēng dōu bù xǐhuan zhège lǎoshī, yuánlái tā de zuòyè tài duō le.</rt></ruby><br>No wonder the students don't like this teacher. He gives too much homework.<br><ruby>怪不得你们 这么 高兴 ，原来是 要 结婚 了 。<rt>Guàibude nǐmen zhème gāoxìng, yuánlái shì yào jiéhūn le.</rt></ruby><br>No wonder you two look so happy. You are getting married.<br><ruby>难怪这里 人 这么 多 ，原来在 打折 。<rt>Nánguài zhèlǐ rén zhème duō, yuánlái zài dǎzhé.</rt></ruby><br>No wonder there are so many people here. There's a sale going on.<br><hr><br>- This usage is definitely less common, but sometimes 难怪 is a combination of the难 + Verbpattern and the verb 怪, meaning 'to blame.' In this case, the meaning is totally different.  Although it's not as common, and you shouldn't need to worry about it too much, we include it here because if you ever run into and think that 难怪 can only ever have one meaning, it can totally throw you for a loop.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>这 也难怪他 ，他 这么 小 。<rt> Zhè yě nánguài tā, tā zhème xiǎo.</rt></ruby><br>We can't really blame him. He's so young.<br><ruby>这 也难怪大家 ，是 我们 通知 晚 了 。<rt>Zhè yě nánguài dàjiā, shì wǒmen tōngzhī wǎn le.</rt></ruby><br>We can't really blame everybody. It was such short notice.<br><hr><br>- When used in this way it expresses that the speaker assigns no blame in the situation he is describing. Sometimes the specific person undeserving of blame is mentioned directly after 难怪, but not always.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGFPV2C		{}
一方面⋯⋯，一方面⋯⋯<br>一 方面他 很 喜欢 这 份 工作 ，一 方面他 又 觉得 工资 太 低 。		- Expressing various aspects with 'yi fangmian'<br>- When talking about various aspects of a situation, 一方面⋯⋯， (另)一方面⋯⋯ (yī fāngmiàn..., (lìng) yī fāngmiàn...) can be used in a way similar to how 'on one hand..., on the other hand...' is used in English.<br>- 一 方面 ⋯⋯ ， (另) 一 方面 ⋯⋯<br>- The two aspects in the sentence can both be similar in tone, and they can also be in direct opposition to each other. You will often see the adverb 又,  也 or 还 following 另一方面, which serves the purpose of emphasis.<br><ruby>自己 做饭一 方面健康 ，一 方面还能 省 点 钱 。<rt>Zìjǐ zuòfàn yī fāngmiàn jiànkāng, yī fāngmiàn hái  néng shěng diǎn qián.</rt></ruby><br>On one hand, cooking for yourself is  healthy; on the other hand, it can also help to save some money.<br><ruby>他一 方面想 改变 ，一 方面又害怕 改变 。<rt>Tā yī fāngmiàn xiǎng gǎibiàn, yī fāngmiàn yòu hàipà gǎibiàn.</rt></ruby><br>On the one hand, he wants to change; on the other hand, he's afraid of change.<br><ruby>我们一 方面不 想 这样 做 ，一 方面必须 这样 做 。<rt>Wǒmen yī fāngmiàn bù xiǎng zhèyàng zuò, yī fāngmiàn bìxū zhèyàng zuò.</rt></ruby><br>On the one hand, we don't want to do it this way; on the other hand, we must do it this way.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCWHNF		{}
等(到) + Time / Event ，Subj. + 再 / 就 ⋯⋯<br>等到大学 毕业 ，我 就 不 住 在 学校 了。		- Expressing 'when' with 'dengdao'<br>- The word 等到 (děngdào) can trip up learners, because while it can literally mean 'to wait until,' it also has the less literal translation meaning 'when (the time comes)' or 'by the time (something happens).' This is a pattern that appears in complex sentences, with 等到 acting as aconjunctionand appearing in the first part as the first word in the sentence.<br>- When talking about the future, the second part of the sentence uses就(jiù) or再(zài).<br>- 等(到) + Time / Event ，Subj. + 再 / 就 + Predicate<br>- Thepredicatepart of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.<br><ruby>等到老板 知道就麻烦 了。<rt>Děngdào lǎobǎn zhīdào jiù máfan le.</rt></ruby><br>When the boss finds out, we'll be in trouble.<br><ruby>等雨 停 了 我再出门 。<rt>Děng yǔ tíng le wǒ zài chūmén.</rt></ruby><br>When the rain stops, I'll go outside.<br><ruby>等到秋天 ，这些 树叶就会 变 黄 。<rt>Děngdào qiūtiān, zhèxiē shùyè jiù huì biàn huáng.</rt></ruby><br>When autumn arrives, these leaves will turn yellow.<br><hr><br>- For the past, the second part of the sentence uses才(cái). This pattern is very similar tohow 直到 (zhídào) is used to mean 'all the way until', and also overlaps with theuse of 才 to express lateness.<br>- 等(到) + Time / Event ，Subj. + 才 + Predicate<br><ruby>等我 回 了 家 ，才发现 手机 忘 在 了 出租车 上 。<rt>Děng wǒ huí le jiā, cái fāxiàn shǒujī wàng zài le chūzūchē shàng.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't realize I left my cell phone in the taxi until I got home.<br><ruby>等到孩子 上 了 小学 ，她才开始 工作 。<rt>Děngdào háizi shàng le xiǎoxué, tā cái kāishǐ gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>She didn't start working until her children had started elementary school.<br><ruby>等学生 都 安静 了 ，老师才开始 上课 。<rt>Děng xuéshēng dōu ānjìng le, lǎoshī cái kāishǐ shàngkè.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher didn't begin the class until the students all became quiet.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG68F61		{}
常常 vs. 经常<br>我不 常运动 ，我 需要经常运动 。		- Comparing 'changchang' and 'jingchang'<br>- Both 常常 (chángcháng) and 经常 (jīngcháng) areadverbsexpressing the idea of 'often,' though their usage differs in some small details.<br>- 常常 and 经常 both can be used to express frequency, meaning 'often,' and that the time between each instance something happens is very short. In this case, they are interchangeable.<br>- 常常 / 经常 + Verb<br><ruby>我常常收到 垃圾 短信 。<rt>Wǒ chángcháng shōudào lājī duǎnxìn.</rt></ruby><br>I often receive spam texts.<br><ruby>你们经常加班 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmen jīngcháng jiābān ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you guys often work overtime?<br><ruby>他们常常吵架 。<rt>Tāmen chángcháng chǎojià.</rt></ruby><br>They often argue.<br><hr><br>- Neither 常常 nor 经常 can be placed before the subject:<br><hr><br>- Note that 常 (by itself) is used forfuturefrequent actions in colloquial Chinese.<br><ruby>常来 玩 ！<rt>Cháng lái wán!</rt></ruby><br>Come hang out often!<br><ruby>常联系 ！<rt>Cháng liánxì!</rt></ruby><br>Let's keep in touch!<br><hr><br>- Although not so commonly used in this way, 经常 can also be used as an adjective referring to things that happens very frequently. 常常 can't be used this way.<br>- A simple example:<br><ruby>她 忘 带 钥匙 是经常的 事情 。<rt>Tā wàng dài yàoshi shì jīngcháng de shìqing.</rt></ruby><br>It's a regular thing for her to forget to bring her keys.<br><hr><br>- 经常 and 常常 can share the same negative form不常. You can also simply use 不 to negate both 经常 and 常常, although 不常常 is not super common.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>他不 常抽烟 。<rt>Tā bù cháng chōuyān.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't smoke very often.<br><ruby>我 妈妈不 经常网购 。<rt>Wǒ māma bù jīngcháng wǎng gòu.</rt></ruby><br>My mother doesn't often shop online.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGE8FLP		{}
刚 vs. 刚才<br>你刚才去 哪儿 了？我刚回来 。		- Comparing 'gang' and 'gangcai'<br>- 刚 (gāng) and 刚才 (gāngcái) have similar meanings of 'just(now),' but they differ on a few key uses.<br>- 刚 is actually anadverb, and it is placed in front of the verb. It emphasizes that the actionjusthappened a short time ago. Unsurprisingly, it is similar to the English 'just.' 刚刚 and 刚 are interchangeable in this case.<br>- The key here is that 'a short time ago' is relative and determined by the speaker. For this reason, 刚 can indicate that something 'just' happened 1 second ago, 5 minutes ago, 2 hours ago, 3 weeks ago, or even a year ago. The absolute time is flexible, but from the speaker's perspective, itfeelsrecent.<br>- One thing that confuses a lot of learners is that when you use 刚 with a verb,you normally don't need 了. Keep that in mind while reading the following examples, and look for the explanation below.<br>- A few examples:<br>- It would be wrong to use 刚才 instead:<br>- And if you mean to say 'when I first arrived in Shanghai,' use 刚 instead of 刚才:<br><ruby>我刚到 上海 的 时候 ，谁 都 不 认识 。<rt>Wǒ gāng dào Shànghǎi de shíhou, shéi dōu bù rènshi.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't know anyone when I had just arrived in Shanghai.<br><hr><br>- 刚, as an adverb, can also be placed in front of an adjective, while 刚才 can't be used this way. 刚 can also be used interchangeably with 刚刚.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>他 的 感冒刚刚好 。<rt>Tā de gǎnmào gānggāng hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>He just recovered from his cold.<br><ruby>天刚晴 。<rt>Tiān gāng qíng.</rt></ruby><br>The sky just became clear.<br><ruby>牛肉刚熟 。<rt>Niúròu gāng shú.</rt></ruby><br>The beef just got cooked.<br><hr><br>- 刚才 is atime noun(like 今天 and 现在), and it expresses that the time elapsed is really short, in near-absolute terms.  We're talking no more than 1-30 minutes in most situations, and often less than 5 minutes. When used before a verb, 刚才 emphasizes something happened 'just now.'<br>- A few examples:<br>- 刚才, as a time noun, can directly modify a noun to indicate it is that one from 'just now' or 'just before,' while 刚 can't be used this way.<br><hr><br>- You may have noticed that something interesting is going on with regards to了in the sentences with 刚 and 刚才. Namely, 了 is not usually required in sentences with 刚, but it is usually required in sentences with 刚才. This is because 刚才 refers to a time in therecent past, and you're usually indicated that somethinghappened just now(started and finished).<br>- Take these sentences for example:<br><ruby>我 昨天 看 了 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān kàn le.</rt></ruby><br>I looked at it yesterday.<br><ruby>我刚才看 了 。<rt>Wǒ gāngcái kàn le.</rt></ruby><br>I looked at it just now.<br><hr><br>- So these are both simple 'subject + verb' sentences. Notice that when they refer to thepast(including the one with 刚才), the action is completed and you need 了. You don't need 了 for things that haven't happened yet (they're just plans, and nothing is completed). And remember that 刚才always refers to the past.<br>- OK, now what about 刚?Why does it not need 了?The key is that you don't need a 了 in a sentence with 刚 if the verbalready indicates a clear result. So, to use the 看 example from above:<br>- A few more examples:<br>- There's also something going on with没in sentences with 刚 and 刚才. The deal here is that you can say somethingdidn't happenjust now(刚才), but you can't say that somethingjustdidn't happen(刚). [Saying that something 'just didn't happen' only works in English if you interpret 'just' to mean 'simply.']<br>- The takeaway? Just don't use 刚 in sentences where you use 没 to negate the past.<br>- Use 没 with 刚才 (and no 了) to negate the past.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGJFFWG		{}
有点 vs. 一点<br>这 衣服有点贵 ，便宜一点吧。		- Comparing 'youdian' and 'yidian'<br>- 一点 (yīdiǎn) and 有点 (yǒudiǎn), usually pronounced 一点儿 (yīdiǎnr) and 有点儿 (yǒudiǎnr) in northern China, mean pretty much the same thing on the surface—'a little' or 'a bit'—but they have different uses in sentences.<br>- 有点 is placed before an adjective, and while used for descriptions, it also expresses a tone of complaint by the speaker, or some other form of negative impression. It doesn't just mean 'a bit,' but rather 'a bittoo' (for the speaker's liking).<br>- A few examples:<br>- 一点 can't be placed before an adjective. Instead, it is placedafteradjectives. The adjectives that can be used are particularly limited. 一点 is often used when comparing, requesting, or expressing the speaker’s expectation. In this usage, 一点 can also be shortened to just 点。<br>- A few examples:<br>- 一点 can be placed before a noun to mean 'small quantity,' like 一点水，一点钱 while 有点 can't be used this way. Note that 有点 is also a shortened form of 有一点, which means 'there is a little' of something.<br>- A few examples to help you understand:<br><ruby>你 脸 上有 一 点番茄酱。<rt>Nǐ liǎn shàng yǒu yī diǎn fānqiéjiàng.</rt></ruby><br>There's a little ketchup on your face.<br><ruby>你 碗里 还有 点饭，吃 完 吧 。<rt>Nǐ wǎn lǐ hái yǒu diǎn fàn, chī wán ba.</rt></ruby><br>There's still a little rice in your bowl. Finish eating it.<br><hr><br>- After 有点, you can use 不 or 没 before the adjective, however the adjective should have a positive connotation, like 高兴 (gāoxìng), 舒服 (shūfu), 喜欢 (xǐhuan), etc. This makes the overall emotion expressed  negative still.<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>孩子们有点不喜欢 我们 的 新 家 。<rt>Háizi men yǒudiǎn bù xǐhuan wǒmen de xīn jiā.</rt></ruby><br>The children don't really like our new home.<br><ruby>她有点不舒服 。<rt>Tā yǒudiǎn bù shūfu.</rt></ruby><br>She doesn't feel very well.<br><ruby>我有点不相信 那 个人 。<rt>Wǒ yǒudiǎn bù xiāngxìn nàge rén.</rt></ruby><br>I don't really believe that guy.<br><hr><br>- 一点 can also be used in the一点也不 or 一点也没 structureto mean 'not at all.'<br>- Some examples:<br><ruby>这个 菜一点 也不辣 。<rt>Zhège cài yīdiǎn yě bù là.</rt></ruby><br>This dish is not spicy at all.<br><ruby>作业 你一点 也没做 ？<rt>Zuòyè nǐ yīdiǎn yě méi zuò?</rt></ruby><br>You didn't do any homework at all?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGV55Y4		{}
会 vs. 能 vs. 可以<br>我会跳舞 。这里 不能跳舞 。我可以请 你 跳舞 吗 ？		- Comparing 'hui,' 'neng,' 'keyi'<br>- The threemodal verbs会 (huì), 能 (néng), and 可以 (kěyǐ) are all often translated as 'can' in English. Sometimes they are explained as: 会 means 'know how to,' 能 means 'to be able to,' and 可以 means 'to have permission to.' This is a useful way of thinking about them, but in reality their usage does overlap somewhat.<br>- The words 会, 能, and 可以 actually overlap a little in meaning. The first step is to understand their basic meanings, though:<br>- As for overlap, this graphic helps explain nicely:<br>- The regions marked by letters are explained in the sections below:<br>- Both 会 and 能  can be used to express ability in something.<br>- 会／能 + Verb<br><ruby>我们 都会游泳 。<rt>Wǒmen dōu huì yóuyǒng.</rt></ruby><br>We all know how to swim.<br><ruby>他 不会修 电脑 。<rt>Tā bù huì xiū diànnǎo.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't know how to fix computers.<br><hr><br>- 可以 is used to ask for or give permission. However, 能 can also be used to replace 可以 interchangeably.<br>- Note:When a question is asked using 能 or 可以 it can be answered with 不能 or 不可以, meaning no, and only 可以 meaning yes. Chinese don't really answer with just 能 when it comes to permission.<br>- 可以 / 能 + Verb<br>- 能 and 可以 can also be used to express possibility.<br>- 可以 / 能 + Verb<br><ruby>明天 你能早点 来 吗 ？<rt>Míngtiān nǐ néng zǎodiǎn lái ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is it possible for you to come a little earlier tomorrow?<br><ruby>可 不 可以换 时间 ？<rt>Kě bu kěyǐ huàn shíjiān?</rt></ruby><br>Is it possible to change the time?<br><hr><br>- Only 会 can be used to mean something is going to happen. It expresses that something in the future will happen and is often used to express trends or possibilities.<br>- 会 + Verb / Adj.<br><ruby>他 不会跟 你 结婚 。<rt>Tā bù huì gēn nǐ jiéhūn.</rt></ruby><br>He's not going to marry you.<br><ruby>你会生 我 的 气 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ huì shēng wǒ de qì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Will you be mad at me?<br><ruby>这样 穿会好看 吗 ？<rt>Zhèyàng chuān huì hǎokàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Will I look good if I dress like this?<br><hr><br>- By placing 很 (hěn) before 会, it adds emphasis to the level of ability and skill on the action presented. 很会 is commonly used to mean 'to be good at' and expresses being very skillful at something, or doing something very well. It can be translated as 'really know how to,' as in 'you really know how to speak Chinese!' Another way to put it is, 'You are good at speaking Chinese.'<br>- When 很 is placed in front of 能, the meaning takes on a amazed/surprised tone on the action. Although more rarely used, it emphasizes quantity and amount. 很能 is most commonly used with 吃(chī) to eat, and 睡 (shuì) to sleep. It's like the English equivalent of saying you 'can really' do something. For example saying that someone 'can reallysleep' means that they can sleep a lot.<br>- Note:很可以 is not a phrase, and therefore this pattern does not apply to 可以.<br>- 很 + 会／能 + Verb<br>- Otherdegree adverbslike 真 (zhēn), 太 (tài), 这么 (zhème), etc. can also be used in place of 很.<br>- Note that 很能说 means someone talksa lot, 很会说 means theyhave a way with words, but 很可以说 is just bad Chinese.<br>- Examples used with other adverbs:<br><ruby>我 的 脚 好 了 ，现在 又能跳舞 了 。<rt>Wǒ de jiǎo hǎo le, xiànzài yòu néng tiàowǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>I am able to dance now since my foot is better. (The condition changed)<br><ruby>我 学 了 两 个 月 ，现在 我会跳舞 了 。<rt>Wǒ xué le liǎng gè yuè, xiànzài wǒ huì tiàowǔ le.</rt></ruby><br>I studied for two months. I know how to dance now.

(Parents gave their permission)<br><hr><br>- Note that none of the three can be followed by the aspectual particle 过.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGZL717		{}
还是 vs. 或者<br>我们 明天 见还是后天 见 ？明天或者后天 都 可以 。		- Comparing 'haishi' and 'huozhe'<br>- Both 还是 (háishì) and 或者 (huòzhě) mean 'or' and are used to present a choice. However, 还是 is normally used when asking a question, and 或者 is mostly for declarative sentences.<br>- When asking a question, 还是 can be used to provide choices or options.<br>- Option A + 还是 + Option B ?<br><ruby>你 喜欢 他还是我 ？<rt>Nǐ xǐhuan tā háishì wǒ? </rt></ruby><br>Do you like him or me? <br><ruby>你 喝 茶还是喝 咖啡 ？<rt>Nǐ hē chá háishì hē kāfēi? </rt></ruby><br>Do you drink tea or coffee? <br><ruby>你 中午 出去 吃还是叫 外卖 ？<rt>Nǐ zhōngwǔ chūqù chī háishì jiào wàimài? </rt></ruby><br>Are you going out for lunch or ordering take-out? <br><hr><br>- 或者 is used in a statement in which options are presented.<br>- Possibility 1 + 或者 + Possibility 2<br>- The structure for 或者 and 还是 is the same, but the meaning, as well as the context in which 或者 is needed, is different. 或者 drops the 'A or B, PICK ONE' attitude in favor of a more open, 'maybe A, perhaps B... (or maybe both or neither?)' So it's less exclusive and less demanding of a choice RIGHT NOW.<br><ruby>周末 我 想 在 家 看书或者看 电影 。<rt>Zhōumò wǒ xiǎng zài jiā kànshū huòzhě kàn diànyǐng.</rt></ruby><br>This weekend, I want to stay home and read or watch movies. <br><ruby>你 可以 坐 1 号 线或者2 号线 去 人民 广场 。<rt>Nǐ kěyǐ zuò yī hào xiàn huòzhě èr hào xiàn qù Rénmín Guǎngchǎng.</rt></ruby><br>You can take Line 1 or Line 2 to People's Square.<br><ruby>我们 可以 电话或者邮件 联系 。<rt>Wǒmen kěyǐ diànhuà huòzhě yóujiàn liánxì.</rt></ruby><br>We can contact each other by phone or email.<br><hr><br>- Deciding whether or not to use 还是 becomes difficult with sentences that contain statements like 'I don’t know,' 'I want to know,' 'I’m not sure,' etc. Alone, these statements are not technically questions. However, when used in a sentence that contains choices, these statements imply that a question must be answered. Therefore, you must use 还是.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>我不 知道这 本 书 是 他 的还是我 的 。<rt> Wǒ bù zhīdào  zhè běn shū shì tā de háishì wǒ de.</rt></ruby><br>I don't know if this book is his or mine.<br><ruby>我想 知道他们 是 支持还是反对 。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng zhīdào tāmen shì zhīchí háishì fǎnduì.</rt></ruby><br>I want to know if they support or oppose.<br><ruby>老板不 确定是 这 个 周末 出差还是下 个 周末 出差 。<rt>Lǎobǎn bù quèdìng shì zhège zhōumò chūchāi háishì xià gè zhōumò chūchāi.</rt></ruby><br>The boss isn't sure if he's going on a business trip this weekend or next weekend.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQJ5IC		{}
人家 vs. 别人<br>因为人家喜欢 你 啊 。我 不 在乎别人怎么 说 。		- Comparing 'renjia' and 'bieren'<br>- When referring to other people, we can use both the words 人家  (rénjia) and 别人 (biérén). But 人家 has additional grammatical uses which we will explore in this article.<br>- 人家 and 别人 both refer to others besides the speaker and the listener. However, 人家 is more colloquial.<br>- 人家 and 别人 are interchangeable in these sentences below.<br><ruby>我 不 在乎人家怎么 说 。<rt>Wǒ bù zàihu rénjia zěnme shuō.</rt></ruby><br>I don't care about what other people say.<br><ruby>别人怎么 想 我 怎么 知道 ？<rt>Biérén zěnme xiǎng wǒ zěnme zhīdào?</rt></ruby><br>How could I know what other people are thinking?<br><ruby>那 是人家的 事 ，你 管 那么 多 干嘛 ？<rt>Nà shì rénjia de shì, nǐ guǎn nàme duō gàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>That's other people's business. Why get involved?<br><hr><br>- For these additional uses of 人家, it would be incorrect to use 别人.<br>- 人家 can be used to refer to yourself, and it is often used this way by women, giving it a sort of girly, shy, tender feeling.<br><ruby>因为人家喜欢 你 啊 。<rt>Yīnwèi rénjia xǐhuan nǐ a.</rt></ruby><br>Because I like you!<br><ruby>讨厌 ！老是 拿人家开玩笑 。<rt>Tǎoyàn! Lǎo shì ná rénjia kāiwánxiào.</rt></ruby><br>You are so annoying! You're always making fun of me.<br><hr><br>- 人家 can also refer to someone previously referred to (in the context of the conversation or body of text) or it can refer to a certain someone that both the speaker and listener know.<br><ruby>你 快 给人家道歉 。<rt>Nǐ kuài gěi rénjia dàoqiàn.</rt></ruby><br>Apologize to them now.<br><ruby>你 看人家多 聪明 ！<rt>Nǐ kàn rénjia duō cōngming!</rt></ruby><br>Look how smart he is!<br><hr><br>- 人家 can also refer to households. In this case, it's pronounced as 'rénjiā' rather than 'rénjia.' This use is going to be the least common in everyday spoken Chinese.<br><ruby>这个 小区 有 多少户人家？<rt>Zhège xiǎoqū yǒu duōshao hù rénjiā?</rt></ruby><br>How many households are here in this neighborhood?<br><ruby>村子 里 现在 只 剩 十户人家了 。<rt>Cūnzi lǐ xiànzài zhī shèng shí hù rénjiā le.</rt></ruby><br>There are only ten households left in this village.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGPINA4		{}
之间 vs. 中间<br>八 点 到 十 点之间我 都 有空 。客厅 的中间有 一 个 沙发 。		- Comparing 'zhijian' and “zhongjian'<br>- When describing spatial relationships, the words 之间 (zhījiān) and 中间 (zhōngjiān) will come in handy to express the concepts of 'between' and 'among.'  Both have a few particular uses, though.<br>- 之间 and 中间 can both refer to a space 'in the middle' between two points, as long as we're talking about physical space.<br>- A + 和 + B + 之间／中间<br><ruby>上海 在 江苏 省 和 浙江 省之间/中间。<rt>Shànghǎi zài Jiāngsū Shěng hé Zhèjiāng Shěng zhījiān / zhōngjiān.</rt></ruby><br>Shanghai is between Jiangsu Province and Zhejiang Province.<br><ruby>我 家 客厅 和 卧室中间是 洗手间 。<rt>Wǒ jiā kètīng hé wòshì zhōngjiān shì xǐshǒujiān.</rt></ruby><br>Our bathroom is between the bedroom and the living room.<br><hr><br>- Grammatically, both 之间 and 中间 are nouns (location nouns, to be precise). One difference between the two, however, is that 中间 can be used all by itself, but 之间 is always used together with other words.<br><hr><br>- 中间 can be used for describing location within an object. This 'within' could be 'inside' a space, like inside a house, in the middle (center) of a table, or in the middle of the screen. You can't use 之间 in this way.<br>- Place (+ 的) + 中间<br><ruby>客厅 的中间有 一 个 沙发 。<rt>Kètīng de zhōngjiān yǒu yī gè shāfā.</rt></ruby><br>There is a sofa in the middle of the living room.<br><ruby>我 的 座位 在第 七 排中间。<rt>Wǒ de zuòwèi zài dì-qī pái zhōngjiān.</rt></ruby><br>My seat is in the middle of Row 7.<br><ruby>把 花 放 在桌子中间。<rt>Bǎ huā fàng zài zhuōzi  zhōngjiān.</rt></ruby><br>Put the flowers in the middle of the table.<br><hr><br>- Try not to say:<br><hr><br>- 中间 is used when referring to one (or more) 'among many.'<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>你们中间有 会 唱歌 的 吗 ？<rt>Nǐmenzhōngjiān yǒu huì chànggē de ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can anyone among you sing?<br><ruby>这些 人中间我 只 认识 一 个 。<rt>Zhèxiē rén zhōngjiān wǒ zhī rènshi yī gè.</rt></ruby><br>Among these people, I only know one person.<br><hr><br>- 之间 can't be used to mean 'among' like this.<br>- This usage refers to examples like 'between 8am and 3pm' or 'between 20 and 30'.<br>- A + 到 + B + 之间<br><ruby>你 可以 明天 早上 八 点到十 点之间过来 。<rt>Nǐ kěyǐ míngtiān zǎoshang bā diǎn dào shí diǎn zhījiān guòlái.</rt></ruby><br>You can come between 8am and 10am tomorrow.<br><ruby>45 岁到60 岁之间的 人 很 容易 得 这种病 。<rt>Sìshí-wǔ suì dào liùshí suì zhījiān de rén hěn róngyì dé zhè zhǒng bìng.</rt></ruby><br>People aged 45 to 60 years old are susceptible to this disease.<br><hr><br>- The idea is that the relationship is 'between' two or more people, with the abstract 'between' part indicated by 之间. This usage of 之间 can also refer to relationships between two (or more) companies, countries, etc., but mostly it's used between people. 中间 can't be used in this way.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>夫妻之间应该 多 交流 。<rt>Fūqī zhījiān yīnggāi duō jiāoliú.</rt></ruby><br>There should be plenty of communication between husband and wife.<br><ruby>你们之间到底 发生了 什么 事情 ？<rt>Nǐmen zhījiān dàodǐ fāshēng le shénme shìqing?</rt></ruby><br>What exactly happened between the two of you?<br><ruby>她 不 太 会 处理上下 级之间的 关系 。<rt>Tā bù tài huì chǔlǐ shàng-xià jí zhījiān de guānxi.</rt></ruby><br>She doesn't really understand how to handle the relationships between superiors and subordinates.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGN6O6J		{}
离 vs. 从<br>从明天 开始，我 不 抽烟 了。		- Comparing 'li' and 'cong'<br>- Both离 (lí)and从 (cóng)can be translated into English as 'from.' In Chinese, however, their meanings are different. 从 is used in cases where the subject's position relative to a fixed location changes. 离 expresses a 'static' distance, or a distance that is unchanging. Both can be used in defining distance or time, however 从 has more meanings than 离.<br>- 从 + Time / Event + 开始 / 起<br><ruby>从下 个 月起，公司 会 越来越 忙 。<rt>Cóng xiàge yuè qǐ, gōngsī huì yuèláiyuè máng.</rt></ruby><br>Starting from next month, the company will be busier and busier.<br><ruby>从我 上 小学开始，就 特别 喜欢 画画 。<rt>Cóng wǒ shàng xiǎoxué kāishǐ, jiù tèbié xǐhuan huà huà.</rt></ruby><br>I have really liked drawing since starting elementary school.<br><hr><br>- 从那以后 means 'ever since then,' while 从今以后 means 'from now on.'<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>从 那以后，我们 就 没有 联系 了 。<rt>Cóng nà yǐhòu, wǒmen jiù méiyǒu liánxì le.</rt></ruby><br>Ever since then, we haven't been in touch.<br><ruby>从 今以后，我 不用 再 加班 了 。<rt>Cóng jīn yǐhòu, wǒ bùyòng zài jiābān le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't need to work late from now on.<br><hr><br>- 从 + Place + 上 / 里<br><ruby>你 是 不 是从我 包 里拿 了 一百块钱 ？<rt>Nǐ shì bu shì cóng wǒ bāo lǐ ná le yī bǎi kuài qián?</rt></ruby><br>Did you take one hundred RMB from my purse?<br><ruby>我从他 身上学到 了 很多 东西 。<rt>Wǒ cóng tā shēnshang  xuédào le hěn duō dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>I learned a lot from him.<br><ruby>从这 件 事可以 看出 你 的 工作 态度 。<rt>Cóng zhè jiàn shì kěyǐ kànchū nǐ de gōngzuò tàidu.</rt></ruby><br>From this incident, we can see your attitude toward work.<br><hr><br>- Place 1 + 离 + Place 2 + 远 / 近<br><hr><br>- Try not to say:<br><hr><br>- Past Event 1 + 离 + Time + Duration<br>- If you want to say 'from now,' try this pattern:<br>- 离 + Future Event + 还有 + Duration<br><ruby>上次 见面离今天 快 十 年 了 。<rt>Shàng cì jiànmiàn lí jīntiān kuài shí nián le.</rt></ruby><br>It's been about 10 years since we met last time.<br><ruby>离我们 的 婚礼还有两个 星期 。<rt>Lí wǒmen de hūnlǐ háiyǒu liǎng gè xīngqī.</rt></ruby><br>We still have two weeks until our wedding.<br><ruby>离毕业还有几 个 月 。<rt>Lí bìyè háiyǒu jǐ gè yuè.</rt></ruby><br>I am a few months away from graduation.<br><hr><br>- 离⋯⋯还远呢 expresses that something is very far off in terms of time.<br><ruby>我们 刚刚 开始 谈 恋爱 ，离结婚还远呢 。<rt>Wǒmen gānggāng kāishǐ tán liàn’ài, lí jiéhūn háiyuǎn ne.</rt></ruby><br>We've just started our relationship.

以后 vs 的时候<br>打 篮球的 时候会 出 了 很 多 汗 ，所以 打 完 篮球以后我 要 洗澡 。		- Comparing 'yihou' and 'de shihou'<br>- When talking about when something happens, 以后 (yǐhòu) and 的时候 (de shíhou) are often used. They can both be translated as the English word 'when,' but their usage in Chinese must be kept straight.<br>- 以后 and 的时候 both appear in the same place in the sentence: after the verb.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 以后／的时候，⋯⋯<br>- The difference comes in what they actually mean.<br>- 以后technically means after, so it is usedafterthe action is completed. This can be seen as a way of saying 'When you are done (verb)ing.' This might seem obvious, but in the following sentences, we could use 'when' in English for every single one.<br><ruby>下 飞机以后给 我 打电话 。<rt>Xià fēijī yǐhòu  gěi wǒ dǎ diànhuà</rt></ruby><br>Give me a call after you get off the plane.<br><ruby>来 中国以后我 才 发现 中国 菜 那么 好吃 。<rt>Lái Zhōngguó yǐhòu  wǒ cái fāxiàn Zhōngguó cài nàme hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br> Only when I got to China did I realize how tasty Chinese food is.<br><ruby>毕业以后我 打算 去 上海 工作 。<rt>Bìyè yǐhòu  wǒ dǎsuàn qù Shànghǎi gōngzuò. </rt></ruby><br>I plan to find a job in Shanghai after I graduate.<br><hr><br>- 的时候 means 'when' in the sense ofduring an action. For example, 'when you play ball' can be seen as 'when you are playing ball.' It is this sort of difference that can make 以后 and 的时候 slightly confusing at times.<br><ruby>吃饭的时候看 电视 容易 长 胖 。<rt>Chīfàn de shíhou  kàn diànshì róngyì zhǎng pàng. </rt></ruby><br>It's easy to get fat if you eat while you watch TV.<br><ruby>工作的时候不要 上网 聊天 。<rt>Gōngzuò de shíhou  bùyào shàngwǎng liáotiān. </rt></ruby><br>Don't chat online when you're at work.<br><ruby>无聊的时候可以 做 些 什么 ？<rt>Wúliáo de shíhou  kěyǐ zuò xiē shénme? </rt></ruby><br>What can you do when you're bored?<br><hr><br>- 的时候 is also similar to usingthe 一边 structure. However, 一边 uses two conscious actions that you do, whereas '的时候' can be used for 'mindless' activities (like watching TV) or unexpected situations.<br>- There are instances whereboth以后 and 的时候 could work and still mean the same thing. These are times when there isn't really a duration, it just happens in an instant. For example, 'when you see her.' This means, 'as soon as you see her,' as there is only one point where you first see a person. In this case, you can use either one.<br><ruby>雨 停 了的时候，我们 就 去 公园 玩。<rt>Yǔ tíng le de shíhou , wǒmen jiù qù gōngyuán wán.</rt></ruby><br>When it stops raining, we'll go play in the park.<br><ruby>雨 停 了以后，我们 就 去 公园 玩。<rt>Yǔ tíngle yǐhòu , wǒmen jiù qù gōngyuán wán. </rt></ruby><br>When it stops raining, we'll go play in the park.<br><ruby>商店 关门 的时候，你 再 来 找 我。<rt>Shāngdiàn guānmén de shíhou , nǐ zàilái zhǎo wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>Come to find me when the shop is closed.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGLNKZR		{}
Adj. + 得不得了<br>爸爸 气得 不得了，你 要 倒霉 啦。		- Adjectival complement 'de budeliao'<br>- Used by itself, 不得了 (bùdéliǎo) means 'terrible' or 'awful.' But as acomplement, -得不得了 (de bùdéliǎo) can be used to suggest a situation is serious or may result in terrible consequences. It can also be used in a positive sense, such as in English when we say 'I'm terribly happy.'<br>- Adj. + 得不得了<br><ruby>爸爸气得 不得了，你 要 倒霉 啦。<rt>Bàba qì de bùdéliǎo, nǐ yào dǎoméi la.</rt></ruby><br>Dad is super angry.

How can it be this cold?<br><hr><br>- As with many other grammar patterns, -得不得了 works with both adjectives andpsychological verbs.<br>- A word to the wise: don't confuse 得不得了 (de bùdéliǎo) with不得不 (bùdébù).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGB8BWA		{}
Adj. + 得 很<br>这个 题目 简单得 很。		- Adjectival complement 'de hen'<br>- The complement -得很 (dehěn) is used after adjectives to add intensity. Although less common in everyday speech, meaning-wise it is quite similar toadding 很 before the adjective. The main difference is that 'adjective + 得很' is more informal, and adds stronger emphasis than just '很 + adjective.'<br>- Adj. + 得很<br><ruby>我好得 很，你 不用 为 我 担心 。<rt>Wǒ hǎo de hěn, nǐ bùyòng wèi wǒ dānxīn.</rt></ruby><br>I'm doing great. You don't need to worry about me.<br><ruby>你 觉得 不 好吃 ？我 觉得好吃得很。<rt>Nǐ juéde bù hǎochī? Wǒ juéde hǎochī de hěn.</rt></ruby><br>You don't think it tastes good?

Adj. + 了 + (一) 点儿<br>那个 地方 离 我家远了 点儿。		- Expressing 'a bit too'<br>- 了一点儿 (le yīdiǎnr), can be added after an adjective to mean 'just a little bit too....' It is softer in tone thanusing 太, and so is often used when the speaker doesn't want to insult the listener by criticizing too bluntly.<br>- In this structure, the overall effect of the pattern depends on the preceding adjective. If the adjective in the structure has a negative meaning, then it is used to show the speaker’s dissatisfaction (a sort of complaint). If the adjective in the structure has a positive meaning, then it usually reflects a change.<br>- Adj. + 了（一）点儿<br><ruby>这 条 牛仔裤 好像短了 点儿。<rt>Zhè tiáo niúzǎikù hǎoxiàng duǎn le diǎnr.</rt></ruby><br>This pair of jeans seems a little short for me.<br><ruby>那个 地方 离 我 家远了 一点儿。<rt>Nàge dìfang lí wǒ jiā yuǎn le yīdiǎnr.</rt></ruby><br>That place is a little too far from my home.<br><ruby>这 件 衬衫小了 点儿，我 想 换 一 件。<rt>Zhè jiàn chènshān xiǎo le diǎnr, wǒ xiǎng huàn yī jiàn.</rt></ruby><br>This shirt is a little small. I want to exchange it for another one.<br><hr><br>- 稍微 (shāowēi) can also be added before the adjective to further soften the tone.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEHTV5		{}
Subj. + 有的是 + Noun<br>川菜 上海有的是。		- Saying 'a lot' with 'youdeshi'<br>- In Chinese there is no shortage of ways to say 'a lot.' 有的是 (yǒudeshì) is one of those ways. However, we need to be very clear: 有的是 isnotthe same as有的(meaning 'some') + 是. As a single phrase, 有的是 indicates that the amount or quantity of something is very large, and it can sometimes indicate a tone of exaggeration.<br>- Subj. + 有的是 + Noun<br>- You can also put the noun at the beginning of the sentence, and put 有的是 at the end, like so:<br>- Noun + Subj. + 有的是 。<br><ruby>他 爸 是 大 老板 ，有的是钱 。<rt>Tā bà shì dà lǎobǎn, yǒudeshì qián.</rt></ruby><br>His dad is a big boss.

I've got plenty of strength.<br><hr><br>- It's important to note that '有的是' cannotbe directly negated. If you want to make a negative statement, you'll just have to use 没有很多.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGVACYB		{}
Subj. + 都 + Predicate<br>我都能闻见面包的香味。		- Advanced uses of 'dou'<br>- In its simplest terms, 都 (dōu) means 'all,' but there are also many other advanced uses for it.<br>- 都 can also mean 甚至 (shènzhì), meaning 'even to the point that,' and in this form it expresses emphasis.<br>- Subj. + 都 + Predicate<br><ruby>我 很 想 妈妈 ，有时候 我都能 看见 她 。<rt>Wǒ hěn xiǎng Māma, yǒu shíhou wǒ dōu néng kànjiàn tā.</rt></ruby><br>I really miss Mom.

I can even tell what your next move will be.<br><hr><br>- This pattern overlaps a little with the都……了 pattern used to mean 'already.'It still has some of that 'already,' flavor, but with some of 'since' added in as well.<br>- 'Since ..., in that case...“ can also be conveyed with 都 and a repeating verb, similar to'既然⋯⋯就'.<br>- Verb + 都 + Verb 了，...<br><ruby>来都来 了 ， 就 先 别 急着 走 了 。<rt>Lái dōu lái le, jiù xiān bié jízhe zǒu le.</rt></ruby><br>You're here already.

You might argue that this is simplythe 'all' adverb 都, and you wouldn't be wrong, but this usage is so common that it's worth special attention.<br>- 都 + 怨 / 是 / 怪 + Somebody<br><ruby>都怪 你，出门 不 带 伞。<rt>Dōu guài nǐ, chūmén bù dài sǎn.</rt></ruby><br>It's all your fault, leaving without bringing an umbrella.<br><ruby>都是 你，害 我 跑 这么 远。<rt>Dōu shì nǐ, hài wǒ pǎo zhème yuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>It's because of you, making me go all that way.<br><ruby>都怨 你，不 提前 订好 座位。<rt>Dōu yuàn nǐ, bù tíqián dìng hǎo zuòwèi.</rt></ruby><br>I blame you for not making the reservation earlier.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQFW44		{}
Subj. + 还 + Predicate + 呢<br>还好朋友呢，天天 说 我 坏话 。		- Advanced uses of 'hai'<br>- Aside from itsother uses, 还 (hái) can be used to express a surprised or sarcastic tone, and can also be used with rhetorical questions.<br>- Often used with 呢, this sentence structure expresses that the situation as irrational, uncommon, or unexpected.<br>- Subj. + 还 + Predicate (+ 呢)<br><ruby>这个 小孩还真 聪明 ！<rt>Zhège xiǎohái hái zhēn cōngming!</rt></ruby><br>This kid is brilliant!<br><ruby>还留 过 学呢，英语 这么 差 ！<rt>Hái liú guo xué ne, Yīngyǔ zhème chà!</rt></ruby><br>He's even studied abroad, yet his English is so terrible!<br><ruby>都 怪 你 ，你还生气呢。<rt>Dōu guài nǐ, nǐ hái shēngqì ne.</rt></ruby><br>It's all your fault, yet you're the one who's mad.<br><hr><br>- It can also be used to express astonishment, dissatisfaction, or sarcasm.<br>- Subj. + 还 + Noun Phrase (+ 呢)<br><ruby>还好朋友呢，天天 说 我 坏话 。<rt>Hái hǎo péngyou ne, tiāntiān shuō wǒ huàihuà.</rt></ruby><br>What a 'good friend'!

总 + Verb Phrase<br>咱们总得 想 个 办法 啊。总不 能 让 他 一个人 去 吧？		- Advanced uses of 'zong'<br>- 总 (zǒng) can often be simply translated as 'always,' but it has other advanced uses as well. It can express 'no matter how long or under what circumstances, facts are facts.' It can also express 'no matter what.'  It is often paired with other words to form set phrases such as 总会, 总归, 总得, 总要, 总能, etc. It can also be structured together with other unconditional compound phrases like无论and不管. You cannot place it directly after the verb.<br>- In this structure, 总, with its companion character (usually a modal/auxiliary verb), means 'always will (fill in character/action here)' Once again, it gives the feeling of something very concrete and factual. As you'll see in the examples, below, however, the word 'always' don't always work well in a natural translation to English.<br>- 总 + 会 / 得 / 要 / 能 + Verb Phrase (+ 吧)<br><ruby>这里 是 他 家，他总 会回来 的。<rt>Zhèlǐ shì tā jiā, tā zǒng huì huílái de.</rt></ruby><br>This is his home.

看来 + Judgment to the Situation；在 + Person + 看来<br>看来他不来了，都这么晚了。		- Assessing situations with 'kanlai'<br>- 看来 (kànlái) can be translated as 'apparently' or 'it seems' and is used by the speaker to introduce his understanding of a situation.<br>- Don't confuse看来 with 看起来 (kànqilai), which means 'it looks like.'<br>- When speaking objectively about a situation, you can simply say 看来 and then state your perspective.<br>- 看来 + Perspective<br><ruby>看来他 不 来 了，都 这么 晚 了。<rt>Kànlái tā bù lái le, dōu zhème wǎn le.</rt></ruby><br>It seems he's not coming.

The line is so long.<br><hr><br>- 看来 can also be used to highlight a specific person's point of view. This is like saying 'the way he/she sees it...' You can also say 在我看来, which is the longer version of just using 看来. It is used more often that way in formal speaking and writing, as it has more of a feeling like saying, 'in my opinion....'<br>- 在 + Person + 看来 + Perspective<br><ruby>在我看来，不 会 花 钱 的 人 就 不 会 享受 生活。<rt>Zài wǒ kànlái, bù huì huā qián de rén jiù bù huì xiǎngshòu shēnghuó.</rt></ruby><br>The way I see it, people who won't spend money don't enjoy life.<br><ruby>在他看来，公司 大小 不重要，重要 的 是 老板 好 不 好 。<rt>Zài tā kànlái, gōngsī dàxiǎo bù zhòngyào, zhòngyào de shì lǎobǎn hǎo bù hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>In his view, the size of the company isn't important.

只好 + Verb Phrase<br>上 个 周末 下雨 了 ，我们只好待 在 家。		- Declaring the only option with 'zhihao'<br>- 只好 (zhǐhǎo) is an adverb used to express that one 'has no choice but to' or 'has no other option but to.' The option is one the speaker is not fond of.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，(Subj. +) 只好 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>餐厅 都 关门 了 ，我们只好去 吃 KFC 。<rt>Cāntīng dōu guānmén le, wǒmen zhǐhǎo qù chī KFC.</rt></ruby><br>The other restaurants are all closed, so we didn't have a choice but go to KFC to eat.<br><ruby>我 忘 了 预约 ，只好去 排队 。<rt>Wǒ wàngle yùyuē, zhǐhǎo qù páiduì.</rt></ruby><br>I forgot to make an appointment, so I had to wait in line.<br><ruby>他 没有 时间 去 ，只好我 去 。<rt>Tā méiyǒu shíjiān qù, zhǐhǎo wǒ qù.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't have time to go, so I have to go.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG767A2		{}
可 + Adj. (+ 了)<br>这 件 事情 对 他 造成 的 影响可大 了 。		- Emphatic adverb 'ke'<br>- 可 (kě) can be used to intensify an adjective, or to add emphasis to a verb. It is stronger than other modifiers, as 可 compares the speaker‘s expectations with the actual situation. The meaning of 可 is very reliant on context.<br>- 可 is generally used by Northern speakers and is informal, generally only used in spoken Chinese.<br>- 可 + Adj. + 了<br>- The 了 is almost always there, but it's not 100%.<br>- In these examples, 可 is used a bit like 很, as it is used to intensify an adjective:<br>- 可 + Verb Phrase<br>- 了 is not needed in this pattern, but may be present.<br>- In these examples 可 is used with 别, and sounds a bit like 'don't even think about...' in English.<br>- Sometimes 可 acts like 终于 (zhōngyú), meaning 'finally.'<br>- 可 + Verb Phrase + 了<br>- 了 will pretty much always be needed when you're talking about something 'finally' happening.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGSPAKW		{}
毕竟<br>别 怪 他 了 ，毕竟他 还 小 。		- Expressing 'after all' with 'bijing'<br>- 毕竟 (bìjìng) can be used to emphasize a reason or characteristic, and is like 'after all' where you might say, 'he is, after all, only a child.' 毕竟 is used both in spoken and written Chinese.<br>- In its most basic form, you just need to add the 'after all' stuff after the 毕竟, and it could be a reason or a characteristic.<br>- 毕竟 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>别 骂 他 了 ，他毕竟是 孩子 。<rt>Bié mà tā le, tā bìjìng shì háizi.</rt></ruby><br>Stop yelling at him. He's only a kid, after all.<br><ruby>毕竟是 冬天 ，你 还是 多 穿 点 吧 。<rt>Bìjìng shì dōngtiān, nǐ háishì duō chuān diǎn ba.</rt></ruby><br>It's winter, after all.

He's not a local, after all.<br><hr><br>- 虽然 ⋯⋯ ，但 + 毕竟 ⋯⋯ ，(as a result) ⋯⋯<br>- In this structure, the parts after 虽然 (suīrán) and 毕竟 are reasons or characteristics, and the part after (as a result) is a result or conclusion. It's a bit more complex, so pay attention to the different parts in the example sentences below.<br><ruby>虽然他 做错 了，但毕竟他 还是 小，你 就 别 打 他 了 。<rt>Suīrán tā zuòcuò le, dàn bìjìng tā háishì xiǎo, nǐ jiù bié dǎ tā le.</rt></ruby><br>Although he made a mistake, he is, after all, still young. So stop hitting him.<br><ruby>虽然我 穿 了 不 少 衣服，但毕竟是 北方 的 冬天，所以 我 还是 觉得 挺 冷 的。<rt>Suīrán wǒ chuān le bùshǎo yīfu, dàn bìjìng shì běifāng de dōngtiān, suǒyǐ wǒ háishì juéde tǐng lěng de.</rt></ruby><br>Although I'm dressed really warmly, it is, after all, winter in the north.

再不…… 就……<br>再不抢就没 了 。		- Expressing a last chance with 'zaibu... jiu...'<br>- When time is running out and you need to emphasize that someone needs toact nowor elsesomething bad is going to happen, that's when you know you need the pattern 再不…… 就…… (zàibù... jiù...)!<br>- (Subj. +) 再不 …… 就 ……（了）<br>- What comes right after 再不 is the action that needs to be takennow. What comes after 就 is the dire consequences which will immediately result is that action is not taken.<br>- Technically this pattern is just a combination of the'again' in the future 再and the就 for expressing 'then'. But somehow this pattern does not easily come to mind for most learners when you want to express 'if you don't...now.... then...' so it gets its own grammar point.<br>- Note that there is a sense of urgency in each of these sentences, even if the word 现在 isn't present. That's why an implied 'now' has been added in for some English translations.<br><ruby>你再 不走，我就叫 保安 了。<rt>Nǐ zài bù zǒu, wǒ jiù jiào bǎoān le.</rt></ruby><br>If you don't leave now, I'm going to call security.<br><ruby>再 不走 我们 开会就要 迟到 了。<rt>Zài bù zǒu wǒmen kāihuì jiù yào chídào le.</rt></ruby><br>If we don't leave now, we will be late for our meeting.<br><ruby>你再 不努力，你就会 被 淘汰。<rt>Nǐ zài bù nǔlì, nǐ jiù huì bèi táotài.</rt></ruby><br>If you don't start working hard, you're going to get eliminated.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG78FDE		{}
Subj. + 差点没 + Verb<br>路 这么 滑，我差点没摔倒。		- Expressing 'almost' using 'chadian mei'<br>- Logically, 差点没 (chàdiǎn méi) is just a simple extension of差点, adding the negation after it.  In fact, you shouldn't think of it as a single word; think of the 没 as belonging to what follows 差点 and it makes more sense.  Still, it can be a little confusing for many learners, and is worth a closer look.<br>- Obviously, 差点 and 差点儿 are equivalent here.<br>- Subj. + 差点 + 没 + Verb Phrase<br>- Note that the 'Verb Phrase' part is adesired result.  So this structure is literally saying, 'almostdidn't[Verb Phrase].'<br>- Also note that because you're using 没, you don't use 了 after the verb phrase.<br>- This is the weird one. In the following usages, 差点 and 差点没 areequivalent. It's almost as if the 没 is meaningless. You can literally drop it with no change in meaning, butonlywhen there is anundesired resultafter 差点没.<br>- Subj. + 差点 (+ 没) + Verb Phrase<br>- In this pattern, the 'Verb Phrase' part is anundesired result.  So in terms of meaning, this structure is identical to the regular 差点 structure.<br>- Again, because you're using 没 here, you don't use 了 after the verb phrase.<br><ruby>我差点儿 没和 她 撞 在 一起。<rt>Wǒ chàdiǎnr méi hé tā zhuàng zài yīqǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I almost ran into her.<br><ruby>这个 地方 太 大 了，我 走 了 很 久，差点儿 没累 死。<rt>Zhège dìfang tài dà le, wǒ zǒu le hěn jiǔ, chàdiǎnr méi lèi sǐ.</rt></ruby><br>This place is so big.

反正<br>随便 你 信 不 信 ，反正我 不 信 。		- Expressing 'anyway' with 'fanzheng'<br>- Lovers of the word 'anyways' in English, rejoice! The word 反正 (fǎnzhèng) works essemtially the same way. It means 'anyhow,' or 'regardless,' and is used to disregard a previous statement, particularly those involving options or choices.<br>- You can put 反正 in the sentence after a comma or pause, similar to how we use 'anyway' in English. It can be used with '不管.'<br>- [Disregarded Situation] ， 反正 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>不管 他 去 不 去 ，反正我 要 去 。<rt>Bùguǎn tā qù bu qù, fǎnzhèng wǒ yào qù.</rt></ruby><br>Regardless of whether he's going or not, I'm going anyway.<br><ruby>不管 你 信 不 信 ，反正我 信 。<rt>Bùguǎn nǐ xìn bu xìn, fǎnzhèng wǒ xìn.</rt></ruby><br>No matter whether you believe this or not, I believe it anyway.<br><ruby>不管 他 爸爸 是 谁 ，反正我 要 告 他 。<rt>Bùguǎn tā bàba shì shéi, fǎnzhèng wǒ yào gào tā.</rt></ruby><br>No matter who his father is, I'm going to sue him anyway.<br><hr><br>- 反正, in this case, is used to convey a certainty or resolution. It‘s similar to既然 (jìrán). 反正 goes at the beginning of the clause introducing the reason, but that clause can come first or second in the sentence. (既然 is not quite so flexible.)<br>- 反正 + Reason ，Decision / Suggestion<br>- Decision / Suggestion ，反正 + Reason<br><ruby>反正他们 不 来 了，咱们 自己 去 吧。<rt>Fǎnzhèng tāmen bù lái le, zánmen zìjǐ qù ba.</rt></ruby><br>They are not coming anyway, so let's just go by ourselves.<br><ruby>我 就 送 给 你 吧 。反正我 也 不 需要。<rt>Wǒ jiù sòng gěi nǐ ba.

尽量 + Verb<br>我 会尽量想 办法 帮 你 的。		- Expressing 'as much as possible' with 'jinliang'<br>- 尽量 (jǐnliàng) is an adverb meaning 'as much as possible' or 'to the greatest extent.' In this article, we will do our best to explain how to use it!<br>- Using 尽量 is as simple as adding it before a verb (or adjective).<br>- 尽量 + Verb / Adj.<br><ruby>我 会尽量想 办法 帮 你 的。<rt>Wǒ huì jǐnliàng xiǎng bànfǎ bāng nǐ de.</rt></ruby><br>I will try my best to figure out something to help you.<br><ruby>我 会 把 我 知道 的尽量告诉 你 。<rt>Wǒ huì bǎ wǒ zhīdào de  jǐnliàng  gàosu nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I'll do my best to tell you everything I know.<br><ruby>你 看 书 吧，我尽量不 打扰 你。<rt>Nǐ kàn shū ba, wǒ jǐnliàng bù dǎrǎo nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>Go ahead and study, I'll do my best to not disturb you.<br><hr><br>- You may hear the word 尽量 pronounced as both 'jǐnliàng' and 'jìnliàng.' Although 'jǐnliàng' is technically correct and 'jìnliàng' is supposed to be a verb (not an adverb like the word above), many educated native speakers will pronounce 尽量 exclusively as 'jìnliàng.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGINBWJ		{}
恐怕 + Subj. ⋯⋯<br>恐怕今天 做 不 完。		- Expressing concern with 'kongpa'<br>- 恐怕 (kǒngpà) can be used to express 'I'm afraid that,' or 'I'm concerned that,' or even 'I'm worried that,' followed by some sort of reason. It doesn't need to be something you'reliterallyafraid of; it may be that you're just trying to soften the blow of some bad news, as in, 'I'm afraid that I'm too busy washing my hair tomorrow night to come over and see the 2000 pictures of your trip to ComicCon.'<br>- 恐怕 comes at the beginning of the sentence. It's often used with auxiliary verbs such as 要, 会, 能, 得, etc.<br>- (Reason,) 恐怕 + Subj. ⋯⋯<br>- Note that it sounds better to put 恐怕before the subjectof the sentence.<br><ruby>今天恐怕要下雨 。<rt>Jīntiān kǒngpà yào xià yǔ.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid it's going to rain today.<br><ruby>这 件 事恐怕得你 帮忙 。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì kǒngpà děi nǐ bāngmáng.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid we're going to need your help with this matter.<br><ruby>这样 做恐怕不太 合适 。<rt>Zhèyàng zuò kǒngpà bù tài héshì.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid it's not appropriate to do this.<br><hr><br>- 恐怕 is also often used in conjunction with 吧. When it is used with 吧, it expresses a soft but concerned tone and is typically used when the speaker wishes to give their advice or opinion on a matter.<br><ruby>恐怕没 那么 容易吧。<rt>Kǒngpà méi nàme róngyì ba.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid it's not that easy.<br><ruby>一个人 去 那个 地方恐怕不太 安全吧。<rt>Yīgèrén qù nàge dìfang kǒngpà bù tài ānquán ba.</rt></ruby><br>I'm afraid it's not safe to go there alone.<br><ruby>你 这样 说 ，恐怕她 会 不 高兴吧。<rt>Nǐ zhèyàng shuō, kǒngpà tā huì bù gāoxìng ba.</rt></ruby><br>If you put it that way, I'm afraid she will be upset.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD4BA3		{}
好(不)容易<br>我好不容易才 打通 了 银行 的 服务 热线。		- Expressing difficulty with 'hao (bu) rongyi'<br>- 好不容易 (hǎo bù róngyì) means 'very difficult' or 'really not easy.' It is often used where the speaker wants to comment on the result of their hard work, something like 'It was really hard for me to x, but then I realized y.'<br>- Sentences using 好不容易 are often followed by才 (cái), emphasizing the action has been completed only with great difficulty.<br>- Strange as it might seem, 好容易 hasthe same meaningas 好不容易, and can be used interchangeably. 好不容易 is more common.<br>- Subj. + 好 (不) 容易 + 才 + [Result]<br>- The 'result' part can be a simple phrase or a whole clause.<br><ruby>她好容易才减肥 成功。<rt>Tā hǎo róngyì cái jiǎnféi chénggōng.</rt></ruby><br>She had a hard time losing weight and succeeded.. <br><ruby>我好不容易才打通 了 银行 的 服务 热线 。<rt>Wǒ hǎobù róngyì cái dǎtōng le yínháng de fúwù rèxiàn.</rt></ruby><br>It was no easy task to get through to the bank's customer service hotline.<br><ruby>我们好不容易才做完 这 个 项目，结果 合同 取消 了。<rt>Wǒmen hǎobù róngyì cái zuò wán zhège xiàngmù, jiéguǒ hétóng qǔxiāo le.</rt></ruby><br>It was with great difficulty that we finally finished this project. But then the contract was canceled.<br><hr><br>- Verb / [Verb Phrase] + 好容易 / 好不容易<br>- In this simpler structure we use 好(不)容易 by itself to express “with great difficulty”. At the end of the sentence particles such as 啊 or 哦 will also often be used to add emotion.<br><ruby>要 完成 这 个 大 项目好不容易啊。<rt>Yào wánchéng zhège dà xiàngmù hǎobù róngyì a.</rt></ruby><br>Finishing this big project will not be an easy task.<br><ruby>养 大 一 个 孩子好不容易。<rt>Yǎng dà yī gè háizi hǎobù róngyì.</rt></ruby><br>Raising a child is not an easy thing to do.<br><ruby>创办 一 个 公司好不容易啊。<rt>Chuàngbàn yī gè gōngsī hǎobù róngyì a.</rt></ruby><br>Starting a company isn't easy.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG81QV3		{}
甚至<br>他们 贡献 出 所有 的 精力 ，甚至最 宝贵 的 生命 。		- Expressing 'even' with 'shenzhi'<br>- 甚至 (shènzhì) is similar to 'even' in English and is used for emphasis. Like 'even,' it can be used quite directly or in a more subtle manner. When used more subtly it acts to supplement the speaker’s initial thought, creating the impression that the speaker has realized half way through his statement that he hasn’t gone far enough, and wants to take the idea one step further.<br>- Note the word or phrase following 甚至 often uses 也 or 都 to add further emphasis. The noun being emphasized is the 'surprising' one or one that is the most 'extreme.'<br>- [Noun or Group of Nouns] + 甚至 + [Emphasized Noun] + 都 / 也 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>每 个 观众甚至裁判 都 站 起来 给 他 鼓掌。<rt>Měi gè guānzhòng shènzhì cáipàn dōu zhàn qǐlái gěi tā gǔzhǎng.</rt></ruby><br>Each and every member of the audience, and even the referee, stood up and applauded for him.<br><ruby>我 去 过 很 多 中国 的 城市，北京、上海、杭州、昆明、桂林，甚至拉萨 我 也 去 过。<rt>Wǒ qù guo hěn duō Zhōngguó de chéngshì, Běijīng, Shànghǎi, Hángzhōu, Kūnmíng, Guìlín, shènzhì Lāsà wǒ yě qù guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've been to many cities in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Kunming, Guilin.

Subj. + 不得不 + Verb<br>老板 很 讨厌 应酬，但是 她不得不去。		- Expressing 'have to' with 'budebu'<br>- 不得不 (bùdébù) has a stronger tone than 必须 (bìxū) meaning 'someone cannot help but do something.'<br>- Subj. + 不得不 + Verb<br><ruby>你 真的 太 厉害 了 ， 我不得不承认 。<rt>Nǐ zhēn de tài lìhài le, wǒ bùdébù chéngrèn.</rt></ruby><br>You are so good.

到底<br>事情到底是 办 成 了 。		- Expressing 'in the end' with 'daodi'<br>- 到底 (dàodǐ) literally means 'to the bottom,' and often is used where the speaker wants to get to the bottom of a problem or issue, emphasizing or questioning what the real reason for something is.<br>- It is often used like毕竟, to mean 'after all' or 'in the end.' When used in this way, 到底 is used to emphasize a reason or characteristic the speaker considers to be most important.<br>- 到底 ⋯⋯ ，Reason / Characteristic<br><ruby>到底是 个 大 老板，出手 就是 大方 。<rt>Dàodǐ shì ge dà lǎobǎn, chūshǒu jiùshì dàfang.</rt></ruby><br>Look how generous he is with money.

Subj. + 再也 + 不 + Verb Phrase + 了<br>我再也 不想 跟 你 说话 了 。		- Expressing 'never again' with 'zai ye bu'<br>- Sometimes you may do something or experience something that youneverever want to do again. How do we express that in Chinese? One of the ways is to use this quirky combination of three little words: 再也不 (zài yě bù)!<br>- To express that something willneverbe done again, or never happen again, you can use this structure:<br>- Subj. + 再也 + 不 (+ Auxiliary Verb) + Verb Phrase + 了<br>- Notice that 了 is used. In this case it's'change of state 了'. This is becauseit is now the case thatthe action will not be done again. It indicates some kind of determination or decision.<br><ruby>我再也不想 看到 你 了 ！<rt>Wǒ zài yě bù xiǎng kàndào nǐ le!</rt></ruby><br>I never want to see you again!<br><ruby>我再也不想 跟 你 说话 了 。<rt>Wǒ zài yě bù xiǎng gēn nǐ shuōhuà le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't want to talk with you ever again.<br><ruby>我们再也不会 相信 你 了 ！<rt>Wǒmen zài yě bù huì xiāngxìn tā le!</rt></ruby><br>We're not going to believe you ever again!<br><hr><br>- Subj. + 再也 + 没 + Verb + 过 + Obj.<br>- Notice that 过 is used. This pattern expresses that during a certain period of time in thepast, orfroma certain point in the past upuntil now, somethinghasn't been doneagain.<br><ruby>从 那 以后 ，我再也没去 过 酒吧 。<rt>Cóng nà yǐhòu, wǒ zài yě méi qù guo jiǔbā.</rt></ruby><br>Since then, I've never been to a bar again.<br><ruby>出国 以后 ，我再也没吃 过 地道 的 中国 菜 。<rt>Chūguó yǐhòu, wǒ zài yě méi chī guo dìdao de Zhōngguó cài.</rt></ruby><br>Since leaving my country, I've never eaten any authentic Chinese food.<br><ruby>分手 以后 ，他们再也没见 过 。<rt>Fēnshǒu yǐhòu, tāmen zài yě méi jiàn guo.</rt></ruby><br>They haven't seen each other ever since they broke up.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG7R8US		{}
Subj. + 曾经 + Verb + 过 (+ Obj.)<br>他 说 他曾经做过很多 傻事 。		- Expressing 'once' with 'cengjing'<br>- 曾经 (céngjīng) is anadverb, and as such comes before verb phrases in a sentence. It adds the sense of 'once' having happened (the 'once upon a time' meaning of 'once'), sometimes translated as 'ever.' It frequently pairs with 过.<br>- When used with action verbs, 曾经 comes before the verb, which is then followed by 过. Forpsychological verbs, the 过 is optional.<br>- Subj. + 曾经 + Verb + 过 (+ Obj.)<br><ruby>我们曾经一起 去过。<rt>Wǒmen céngjīng yīqǐ qù guò.</rt></ruby><br>We once went there together.<br><ruby>他 说 他曾经做过很多 傻事 。<rt>Tā shuō tā céngjīng zuò guò hěn duō shǎ shì.</rt></ruby><br>He said that he once did a lot of stupid things.<br><ruby>我曾经喜欢过你 。<rt>Wǒ céngjīng xǐhuan guò nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I once liked you.<br><hr><br>- Sometimes 曾经 is used with 了 rather than 过.<br><ruby>为了 找 亲生 父母 ，她曾经花了很 多 钱 。<rt>Wèile zhǎo qīnshēng fùmǔ, tā céngjīng huā le hěn duō qián.</rt></ruby><br>In order to find her biological parents, she once spent a lot of money.<br><hr><br>- 曾经 can also be used with some adjectives. In these cases, 过 is usually also used.<br><ruby>我们 都曾经年轻过。<rt>Wǒmen dōu céngjīng niánqīng guò.</rt></ruby><br>We were all young once.<br><ruby>他 的 音乐曾经流行过。<rt>Tā de yīnyuè céngjīng liúxíng guò.</rt></ruby><br>His music was once popular.<br><hr><br>- When used with the verbs是,在, and有(all related toexistencerather than actions), 过 is generallynotused.<br>- 曾经 + 是 / 在 / 有 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>他曾经是我 老板 。<rt>Tā céngjīng shì wǒ lǎobǎn.</rt></ruby><br>He was once my boss.<br><ruby>这里曾经是一个 学校 。<rt>Zhèlǐ céngjīng shì yī gè xuéxiào.</rt></ruby><br>There was once a school here.<br><ruby>市政府曾经在我们 家 旁边 。<rt>Shì zhèngfǔ céngjīng zài wǒmen jiā pángbiān.</rt></ruby><br>The municipal government [building] was once next to our house.<br><hr><br>- Because过is used to talk about past actions, it should be negated with没(méi). When you mean to say 'I haven't ever (done something)' or '(something) hasn't happened ever,' just say没⋯⋯过. It is incorrect to use 没 or 不 to negate 曾经.<br>- Try not to say:<br><hr><br>- 不曾(bùcéng) and未曾(wèicéng), however, can also  be used to express the above meaning, but they're more formal and thus used only in written language.<br>- 不曾 / 未曾 + Verb + 过 + Obj.<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>他们 一直 写信 ，不曾见过面 。<rt>Tāmen yīzhí xiě xìn, bùcéng jiàn guò miàn.</rt></ruby><br>They've been writing letters to each other, but they've never met.<br><ruby>他 从小 就 没有 父母 ，未曾感受过家庭 的 温暖 。<rt>Tā cóngxiǎo jiù méiyǒu fùmǔ, wèicéng gǎnshòu guò jiātíng de wēnnuǎn.</rt></ruby><br>He's had no parents since he was very young.

本来⋯⋯<br>搬家本来就 很 麻烦。		- Expressing 'originally' with 'benlai'<br>- There are a number of ways to express 'originally' in Chinese, and 本来 (běnlái) is one of the ones first learned, partly because its two characters are so simple.<br>- 本来 means 'originally.' Use it when you need to explain that happened unexpectedly later. Since the action has already happened, the是... 的 constructionis likely appropriate here. 是 is optional.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 是 +（不）[要 / 会 / 应该] + Verb + 的，[但是 / 可是 / 不过]...<br><ruby>我本来是 要 去 的，不过 后来 不 太 舒服 ，就 没 去 。<rt>Wǒ běnlái shì yào qù de, bùguò hòulái bù tài shūfu, jiù méi qù.</rt></ruby><br>I originally wanted to go, but I didn't go because I didn't feel very well.<br><ruby>这些 工作本来是 要 今天 做完 的 ，不过 明天 做 也 可以 。<rt>Zhèxiē gōngzuò běnlái shì yào jīntiān zuò wán de, bùguò míngtiān zuò yě kěyǐ.</rt></ruby><br>This work was originally supposed to be done by today, but it's OK to do it tomorrow.<br><ruby>我本来要 跟 他 结婚 的 ，可是 后来 发现 了 我们 真的 不 合适。<rt>Wǒ běnlái yào gēn tā jiéhūn de, kěshì hòulái fāxiàn le wǒmen zhēn de bù héshì.</rt></ruby><br>I was originally going to marry him, but then I found that we are really not right for each other.<br><hr><br>- If you've got an opinion to express after stating how it 'should be' or 'should not be,' then 本来就 will help you sound more convincing. The end of the sentence usually has an imperative orrhetorical questionthat leads to an opinion or suggestion, emphasizing the tone.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就...<br><ruby>你本来就 够 瘦 了 ，还要 减肥 吗？<rt>Nǐ běnlái jiù gòu shòu le, hái yào jiǎnféi ma?</rt></ruby><br>You are already so thin and you still want to lose weight?<br><ruby>他 讲 得本来就 不 对 ，为什么 还 要 我 听 他 的？<rt>Tā jiǎng de běnlái jiù bù duì, wèishénme hái yào wǒ tīng tā de?</rt></ruby><br>What he says has always been wrong, so why do you still want me to listen to him?<br><ruby>她本来就 很 有钱，当然 买得起 了。<rt>Tā běnlái jiù hěn yǒuqián, dāngrán mǎi deqǐ le.</rt></ruby><br>She is rich. Of course she can afford it.<br><hr><br>- 本来 (běnlái) is used to stress that the speaker believes something to be common knowledge. 'Duh' is probably an overly saracastic and informal English equivalent, so another translation could be 'it goes without saying.' It's often easier to translate the feeling imparted by 本来就 as 'supposed to,' following it with a certain expectation.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就 + 很 / 不 + Adj.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就 + 会 / 要 / 得 / 应该 + Verb	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6F157		{}
再三 + Verb<br>妈妈再三叮嘱 我 ， 要 注意 安全 。		- Expressing 'over and over again' with 'zaisan'<br>- 再三 (zàisān) or means 'repeatedly' or 'time and again' in a formal way, and is usually placed before a two-syllable verb.<br>- Although the verb phrase in the pattern is usually referring to past events, 了 and 过 are generally not used with 再三, but you will sometimes see it.<br>- 再三 + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>老师再三强调 这 次 考试 对 我们 很 重要。<rt>Lǎoshī zàisān qiángdiào zhè cì kǎoshì duì wǒmen hěn zhòngyào.</rt></ruby><br>The teacher has stressed over and over that this exam is really important for us.<br><ruby>这 个 决定 是 经过再三考虑 做 出来 的。<rt>Zhège juédìng shì jīngguò zàisān kǎolǜ zuò chūlái de.</rt></ruby><br>This decision was made after much consideration.<br><ruby>中国 政府再三警告 美国 不要 干涉 中国 的 内政。<rt>Zhōngguó zhèngfǔ zàisān jǐnggào Měiguó bùyào gānshè Zhōngguó de nèizhèng.</rt></ruby><br>China's government has warned the USA repeatedly not to interfere in China's affairs.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGP6LVA		{}
简直⋯⋯<br>她简直要 哭 出来 了 。		- Expressing 'simply' with 'jianzhi'<br>- 简直 (jiǎnzhí) is similar to 'simply' or 'completely' in English, and can be used to modify adjectives or verbs, adding a tone of amazement on the part of the speaker.<br>- Subj. + 简直 + Predicate<br><ruby>这里简直是 天堂！<rt>Zhèlǐ jiǎnzhí shì tiāntáng!</rt></ruby><br>This place is simply heaven.<br><ruby>他 唱歌简直难听 死了 ！<rt>Tā chànggē jiǎnzhí nántīng sǐ le!</rt></ruby><br>His singing is simply awful!<br><ruby>你 男 朋友简直太 帅 了 ！<rt>Nǐ nánpéngyou jiǎnzhí tài shuài le!</rt></ruby><br>Your boyfriend is simply gorgeous!<br><hr><br>- However, although it is possible in English to  say something is 'simply beautiful,' in Chinese, 简直 cannot be followed directly by an unmodified adjective. 很 is also not used after 简直. Check out the following examples:<br><hr><br><hr><br>- When followed immediately by 是, the word 简直 takes on a meaning similar to 'basically.'<br>- Subj. + 简直 + 是 + Predicate<br><ruby>他简直是骗 人 。<rt>Tā jiǎnzhí shì piàn rén.</rt></ruby><br>He's just lying to you.<br><ruby>你简直是多管闲事 。<rt>Nǐ jiǎnzhí shì duō guǎn xiánshì.</rt></ruby><br>You are simply too nosy.<br><ruby>这 个 小狗简直是可爱 极了，越 看 越 喜欢。<rt>Zhège xiǎo gǒu jiǎnzhí shì kě'ài jí le, yuè kàn yuè xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>This puppy is just too cute, the more you look at him the more you like him.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8OLAE		{}
一向 + Verb<br>他 做 事情一向踏实 。		- Expressing 'since the beginning' with 'yixiang'<br>- 一向 (yīxiàng) means 'always,' but is generally used to express a habit, attitude, or convention which has continued for a long period of time until the present. When you use 一向, you're conveying a sense that 'it's always been this way.'<br>- Subj. + 一向 + Habit / Attitude / etc.<br><ruby>小王一向上班 很 早，这次 是 怎么了？<rt>Xiǎo Wáng yīxiàng shàngbān hěn zǎo, zhè cì shì zěnme le?</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Wang has always started work very early.

In this case,一直 should be used:<br>- 一向 indicates that a certain state has continued until the present. It cannot be used to express actions in the future. Again, 一直 can be used instead:<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGACMNQ		{}
千万 + Verb/Verb Phrase<br>千万别 泄露 出 去。		- Expressing 'to make certain' with 'qianwan'<br>- 千万 (qiānwàn) looks like a number ('thousand ten thousand'?) but it actually means 'to make certain.' It is more common in the negative form, but is also used in the positive. It really adds a kick to your sentence!<br>- 千万 usually starts the imperative sentence or phrase, and it is usually paired with 要, 不能, 别 or similar types of words. You can use 千万 with sentences that are commanding someone not do do something, or you can tell them to do something.<br>- 千万 + Verb / Verb Phrase<br>- The following examples use 千万 in the negative tostronglycommand someonenotto do something.<br><ruby>这 个 菜 很 难吃，千万不要点！<rt>Zhège cài hěn nánchī, qiānwàn bùyào diǎn!</rt></ruby><br> This dish is horrible.

白 + Verb<br>白花 了 一 百 块 钱，这 件 衣服 不 能 穿。		- Expressing wasted efforts with 'bai'<br>- 白 (bái) doesn't only mean 'white.' When added before a verb it means to do that verb 'in vain' or 'with no effect.'<br>- All you have to do is put 白 before the verb. One important thing to note is that 白 is usually used with mono-syllabic words, like 做, 学, 跑, etc. You should put a 地 after 白.<br>- 白 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>白花 了 一 百 块 钱，这 件 衣服 不 能 穿。<rt>Bái huā le yībǎi kuài qián, zhè jiàn yīfu bù néng chuān.</rt></ruby><br>I just wasted a hundred kuai.

All that time studying was a waste.<br><hr><br>- 白 can also be replaced with 白白 with basically the same meaning, although 白白 has a stronger emphasis on the 'wasted effort.' 白白 is also usually paired with a disyllabic verb, like 帮助, 准备, 学习 etc. Unlike 白, 白白 can be used with a 地.<br>- 白白 + Verb + 了<br><ruby>明天 不 考 中文， 小王白白准备 了 一 天。<rt>Míngtiān bù kǎo Zhōngwén, Xiǎo Wáng báibái zhǔnbèi le yītiān.</rt></ruby><br>There's no Chinese test tomorrow.

I wasted four hours at the airport waiting for him.<br><hr><br>- There are a group of mono-syllabic verbs that combine with 白 in the same structure, but for these verbs, 白 means 'for free.' Think of these as set phrases. All relate to the senses or some form of 'consumption.' This list is not exhaustive:<br><ruby>白吃<rt>bái chī</rt></ruby><br>to eat for free<br><ruby>白喝<rt>bái hē</rt></ruby><br>to drink for free<br><ruby>白住<rt>bái zhù</rt></ruby><br>to stay (overnight) for free<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGTIMTS		{}
Subj. ＋Verb Phrase 1，顺便 + Verb Phrase 2<br>你 出去 的 时候顺便帮 我 买 杯 咖啡。		- Expressing 'while you're at it' with 'shunbian'<br>- Although sometimes translated as 'in passing' or even 'conveniently,' the most common way that the idea ofadverb顺便 (shùnbiàn) is expressed in English is 'while you're at it' (or 'while I'm at it,' etc.). It's the idea of doing something at a convenient and logical time to save effort. Now you just have to get used to expressing this concept as an adverb.<br>- Subj. + Verb Phrase 1, 顺便 + Verb Phrase 2<br><ruby>你 去 买 早饭 的 时候顺便帮 我 带 杯 咖啡 吧。<rt>Nǐ qù mǎi zǎofàn de shíhou shùnbiàn bāng wǒ dài bēi kāfēi ba.</rt></ruby><br>When you go out to get breakfast can you also bring me a cup of coffee?<br><ruby>你 去 超市 能 不 能顺便帮 我 买 一 瓶 牛奶？<rt>Nǐ qù chāoshì néng bu néng shùnbiàn bāng wǒ mǎi yī píng niúnǎi?</rt></ruby><br>Could you pick me up a bottle of milk while you're at the supermarket?<br><ruby>老板 去 见 客户，顺便吃 了 午饭。<rt>Lǎobǎn qù jiàn kèhù, shùnbiàn chī le wǔfàn.</rt></ruby><br>The boss went to see the client and also ate lunch while he was at it.<br><hr><br>- Here 顺便 means something like 'by the way, I'd like to....'<br>- 顺便 说 一下……<br>- 顺便 问 一下……<br><ruby>顺便说 一下，我 最近 搬家 了。<rt>Shùnbiàn shuō yīxià, wǒ zuìjìn bānjiā le.</rt></ruby><br>By the way, I moved recently.<br><ruby>顺便问 一下，你 下周 什么 时候 回来？<rt>Shùnbiàn wèn yīxià, nǐ xià zhōu shénme shíhou huílái?</rt></ruby><br>By the way, when next week are you coming back?<br><ruby>顺便说 一下，电脑 已经 修 好 了。<rt>Shùnbiàn shuō yīxià, diànnǎo yǐjīng xiū hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>By the way, the computer's been fixed.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5334C		{}
Subj. + Verb + 了 + 又 + Verb<br>他找了又找，还 是 没 找到 他 的 钱 包。		- Repeated actions in the past with 'you'<br>- To emphasize that an action is being repeated again and again, we can place 又 after a verb, then repeat the same verb again.<br>- In the pattern below, 又, together with a repeating verb, indicates that the speaker did something repeatedly (and probably not just twice) in the past. Note that the verb used here must be a single-syllable verb, usually a verb such as 看, 想, 问, 找, or 试. 了 is placed right after the first verb.<br>- Subj. ＋ Verb + 了 + 又 + Verb， (还是 / 就是) ……<br>- Note that '还是' or '就是' is often used to emphasize that 'nothing changed' after all.<br><ruby>这 个 人 我看了又看，还是觉得 我 不 认识 他。<rt>Zhège rén wǒ kàn le yòu  kàn, háishì juéde wǒ bù rènshi tā.</rt></ruby><br>I looked at him again and again, but I still think I don't know him.<br><ruby>我想了又想，还是觉得 不 能 这样 做 。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng le yòu  xiǎng, háishì juéde bù néng zhèyàng zuò.</rt></ruby><br>I thought it over again and again, but I still feel I can't do this.<br><ruby>他找了又找，还是没 找到 他 的 钱 包。<rt>Tā zhǎo le yòu zhǎo, háishì méi zhǎodào tā de qiánbāo.</rt></ruby><br>He searched again and again, and still couldn't find his wallet.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGF08B6		{}
难道⋯⋯？<br>这 都 是 你 引起 的 ，难道你 就 不 内疚 ？		- Rhetorical questions with 'nandao'<br>- Rhetorical questions use the form of a question to emphasize a point, thus do not require an answer. A typical English rhetorical question might be: 'you're not saying you actually believe him, are you?' or 'just how stupid are you?' In Chinese, 难道 (nándào) is used as a marker to form this kind of question. Since we don't 'mark' our rhetorical questions like this in English, this can take some getting used to in Chinese.<br>- 难道 + [Rhetorical Question] + 吗？<br><ruby>难道你 真的 相信 他吗？<rt>Nándào nǐ zhēn de xiāngxìn tā ma?</rt></ruby><br>You don't actually believe him, do you?<br><ruby>难道你 是 我 妈吗？<rt>Nándào nǐ shì wǒ mā ma?</rt></ruby><br>What are you, my mother or something?<br><ruby>今天 是 我 的 生日，难道你 不 知道吗？<rt>Jīntiān shì wǒ de shēngrì, nándào nǐ bù zhīdào ma?</rt></ruby><br>Today's my birthday; you're telling me you didn't know?<br><hr><br>- Note that 难道 can only be used for rhetorical questions which could be answered with yes or no, and generally end with 吗.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMCP9V		{}
Subj. + 差很多<br>中国 文化 和 西方 文化差 很 多。		- The opposite of 'chabuduo' is 'cha hen duo'<br>- You might be used to thinking of 差不多 (chàbuduō) as a single word, and that's totally OK. But if you want to negate the whole idea of rough equivalency, then you need to think of it as a phrase and use 差很多 (chà hěn duō). Not surprisingly, it's a little less versatile than 差不多.<br>- When 差不多 (chàbuduō) is apredicate, it literally means 'the difference is not much.' The opposite, then, would be 差很多 (chà hěn duō), which literally means 'the difference is very great.'  Less literally, if 差不多 means 'more or less the same,' then 差很多 means 'not the same at all' or 'very different.'<br>- Subj. + 差很多<br>- A + 跟 / 和 + B + 差很多<br><ruby>中 西方 的 文化差 很 多。<rt>Zhōng xīfāng de wénhuà chà hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>Chinese culture and western culture are quite different.<br><ruby>这 两 个 词 的 意思 差不多，但是 用法差 很 多。<rt>Zhè liǎng gè cí de yìsi chàbuduō, dànshì yòngfǎ chà hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>The meanings of these two words are basically the same, but their usages are very different.<br><ruby>她和她 老公 的 年龄差 很 多。<rt>Tā hé tā lǎogōng de niánlíng chà hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>There is a big difference between her age and her husband's age.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGQAN74		{}
⋯⋯啊，⋯⋯啊<br>我们 店里 有 水饺啊，盖浇饭啊⋯⋯		- Listing things with 'a'<br>- When listing nouns belonging to a certain category, 啊 (a) can be added to the end of each noun to give an informal feeling a bit like saying 'you know, that kind of thing' after a list of things.

⋯⋯ ，于是 ⋯⋯<br>他 实在 太 懒 了 ，于是老板 把 他 辞 了 。		- Expressing 'and then' with 'yushi'<br>- 于是 is a conjunction used to express a continuation between two events. The second event is the direct result of the first event. You'll often hear 于是 used in storytelling.<br>- 于是 is a conjunction that comes between two clauses. Its closest English equivalent would be 'and then.' Since 于是 can only be used to talk about the past, 了 is often used in the same sentence.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，于是 ⋯⋯ + 了<br><ruby>我 看 大家 都 买 了 ，于是我 也 买了。<rt>Wǒ kàn dàjiā dōu mǎi le, yúshì wǒ yě mǎi le.</rt></ruby><br>I saw everyone was buying it.

When using 因此, it acts as a conjunction that expresses the cause and effect. Because of the reasons in clause one, clause two reaches this result or conclusion.<br><hr><br>- In the incorrect sentence above, it is not two sequential events that happened in the past, so 于是 is not appropriate. In the correct sentence, there is a clear cause-effect relationship, so 因此 is used.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG4FB55		{}
Sentence 1， + 而 + Sentence 2<br>以后 后悔 的 人 不 是 我，而是 你 自己。		- Using 'er' to explain contrasting ideas<br>- The conjunction而(ér) is used to connect two sentences that are related to each other, and is also frequently used to emphasize contrast between two parts of the sentence. Used in this way, it can be translated as 'but rather.' 而 is often used in more formal or literary language, but is also common in everyday speech.<br>- Frequently you'll see the pattern in one of these two more specific forms involving the verb是:<br>- 不是……，而是……<br>- 是……，而不是……<br>- Strictly speaking, the 而 isn'trequiredin either of these patterns, but it makes the contrast super clear.<br><ruby>我们是来 办事 的 ，而 不 是来 玩 的 。<rt>Wǒmen shì lái bànshì de, ér bù shì lái wán de.</rt></ruby><br>We're here to do work, not to have fun.<br><ruby>以后 后悔 的 人不 是我，而 是你 自己。<rt>Yǐhòu hòuhuǐ de rén bù shì wǒ, ér shì nǐ zìjǐ.</rt></ruby><br>The person to later regret this won't be me.

当中<br>他们当中有 温州 人 ， 有 宁波 人 。		- Expressing 'among' with 'dangzhong'<br>- 当中 (dāngzhōng) means 'among,' or more literally 'in the middle of.' In English this is a bit like 'of,' as in, 'ofall of my friends, you are the most loyal.' Also, 当中 can be used to express being 'in the middle' of an activity or process that is fairly formal in nature, such as 'in the middle of negotiations.'<br>- Group / Process + 当中<br><ruby>你 是 我 所有 朋友当中最 聪明 的 一 个。<rt>Nǐ shì wǒ suǒyǒu péngyou dāngzhōng zuì cōngming de yī gè.</rt></ruby><br>Of all of my friends, you are the smartest one.<br><ruby>在 这 一百 个 选手当中我 表现 得 最 出色。<rt>Zài zhè yībǎi gè xuǎnshǒu dāngzhōng wǒ biǎoxiàn de zuì chūsè.</rt></ruby><br>Among these one hundred contestants, my performance was the most outstanding.<br><ruby>他们当中很 多 都 是 上海人。<rt>Tāmen dāngzhōng hěn duō dōu shì Shànghǎi rén.</rt></ruby><br>Among them, there are many Shanghainese.<br><hr><br>- When used to express 'among,' 当中 is a little like其中 (qízhōng).

Furthermore 其中 cannot be used in relation to processes.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGS4DBY		{}
彼此 + Verb<br>太 吵 了，我们 都 听不到对方在 说 什么。		- Expressing 'each other' with 'bici'<br>- 彼此 (bǐcǐ) is a personal pronoun. 彼 (bǐ) is an archaic word meaning 那 (nà) or 'that,' and 此 (cǐ) means 这 (zhè) or 'this.' Therefore, 彼此 (bǐcǐ) literally means 'that and this,' and is used in modern times to mean 'you and me'.<br>- As a personal pronoun, 彼此 (bǐcǐ) is often used as a subject. When used as an object, the verb must be disyllabic and is quite formal in tone.<br>- 彼此 + Predicate<br>- Verb + 彼此<br><ruby>我们 只 见 过 一 次 ，彼此不 是 很 了解 。<rt>Wǒmen zhǐ jiàn guo yī cì, bǐcǐ bù shì hěn liǎojiě.</rt></ruby><br>We've only met once.

I hope we both can perform well.<br><hr><br>- As a personal pronoun, 彼此 (bǐcǐ) is often used as an attributive, modifying a noun.<br>- Sometimes you can also use 彼此 (bǐcǐ) before a noun to make the meaning of the modified noun more abstract.<br>- 彼此 + 的 + Noun<br><ruby>过去 一年 ，我们 见证 了彼此的 进步 。<rt>Guòqù yī nián, wǒmen jiànzhèng le bǐcǐ de jìnbù.</rt></ruby><br> Over the past year, we have witnessed each other's progress.<br><ruby>大家 都 很 辛苦 ，我们 需要 尊重彼此的 努力 。<rt>Dàjiā dōu hěn xīnkǔ, wǒmen xūyào zūnzhòng bǐcǐ de nǔlì.</rt></ruby><br> Everyone is facing hardships, we need to respect each other's efforts.<br><ruby>我们 十年 没 见 了 ，对彼此的 生活 都 不 了解 ，也 很 惊讶彼此的 变化 。<rt>Wǒmen shí nián méi jiàn le, duì bǐcǐ de shēnghuó dōu bù liǎojiě, yě hěn jīngyà bǐcǐ de biànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>It had been ten years since we last met. We didn't really know about each other's lives and we were surprised at how the other had changed.<br><hr><br>- When speaking colloquially, you can repeat 彼此 twice: “彼此彼此”. It's a type of idiom that can mean 'Everyone is the same' or 'We are both the same'.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGF205D		{}
当……的时候，……<br>当我 见到 他 的 时候 ，我 完全 忘 了 要 问 他 什么 。		- Expressing 'when' using 'dang'<br>- 当……时候（dāng... shíhou) means 'when,' very similar to just using时候or时.<br>- 当 + Phrase (+ 时候)，……<br><ruby>当我 有 自行车的 时候，大家 都 开始 骑 电动车 了。<rt>Dāng wǒ yǒu zìxíngchē de shíhou, dàjiā dōu kāishǐ qí diàndòngchē le.When I got a bike, everyone started to riding electric ones.</rt></ruby><br>When I got a bike, everyone started to riding electric ones.<br><ruby>当我 看到 这 张 照片，我 就 想 起 了 你。<rt>Dāng wǒ kāndào zhè zhāng zhàopiàn, wǒ jiù xiǎng qǐ le nǐ.When I saw this photo, I immediately thought of you.</rt></ruby><br>When I saw this photo, I immediately thought of you.<br><ruby>当弟弟 肚子 饿的 时候，他 就 会 哭 得 很 大声。<rt>Dāng dìdi dùzi è de shíhou, tā jiù huì kū de hěn dàshēng.When my little brother is hungry, he will cry loudly.</rt></ruby><br>When my little brother is hungry, he will cry loudly.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG75EE1		{}
其中<br>有 五 个 人 报名 了 ，其中两 个 是 女生 。		- Expressing 'within (it/them)' with 'qizhong'<br>- In classical Chinese, 其 (qí) means 那个, 那, or 那些, and refers to people or things previously mentioned in the sentence. It stands to reason therefore, that  其中 (qízhōng）means 'among the aforementioned' or 那里面, and denotes that something belongs to, is or is part of a bigger group. This is a little like 'of which' in English, where you can say, 'I have three ties, of which two feature Batman.'<br>- Category / Group / Context + 其中<br><ruby>我 有 四 辆 汽车，其中三 辆 都 是 宝马。<rt>Wǒ yǒu sì liàng qìchē, qízhòng sān liàng dōu shì Bǎomǎ.</rt></ruby><br>I have four cars.

This sounds awkward in English, but 其中 is often used in this abstract way.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD1LNT		{}
Noun + 这个 + Category<br>你这个坏蛋，就 没 做 过 一 件 好 事。		- Name-calling with 'zhege'<br>- 这个 (zhège) can be used by the speaker to emphasize how one regards something or someone. Using 这个 has a stronger effect, and is used with both making simple declarative statements as well as with rude name-calling.<br>- Subj. + 这个 + [Category]<br>- When maliciously name-calling, you probably want to use '你这个 [mean name].'<br><ruby>你这个坏蛋，就 没 做 过 一 件 好 事。<rt>Nǐ zhège huàidàn, jiù méi zuò guo yī jiàn hǎoshì.</rt></ruby><br>You're such a bad person!

Verb + Obj. + 了<br>我 吃了早饭 。		- Advanced 'le' after an object<br>- You may have learned that 了 (le) follows immediately after a verb to indicate completion (AKA了1), and comes at the end of a sentence when it indicates a 'change of state' (AKA了2). But 了1 also frequently follows not the verb, but the objectafterthe verb. What are the rules for this? When is it natural and when is it not? That's what this grammar point is about: bringing a bit more depth to your understanding ofexpressing completion with 'le'.<br>- Both of these basic structures are possible (and correct), even when 了 isonlyindicating completion.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Obj.<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. + 了<br>- If it's a rather short and simple sentence, putting 了 directly after the verb, while not technically incorrect, can make the sentence feel incomplete. For example:<br><hr><br>- So for these short sentences, it would be more natural to put 了 after theobject. So what are the rules for when to put 了 directly after the verb, and when to put it after the object? That is the point of this article.<br>- So the question now iswhenit's OK to move the 了 to after the object. Itoftenis. Let's look more closely at the circumstances. Unfortunately, 了 is notorious for evading nice clear rules, but we'll do our best here to provide reliable guidelines for usage.<br>- Subj. + Verb + Obj. + 了<br>- For these examples where the object is short, it sounds better to put 了 after the object. It's notwrongto put the 了 after the verb, but it sounds a little strange to do so. (It may sound stranger for some examples than others, and native speakers will have varying opinions about which sound the strangest. Ask them!)<br><hr><br>- Once the object gets a bit longer, it starts to sound OK again to put the 了 immediately after the verb, but it also sounds good to put it after the (nottoolong) object.<br><hr><br>- Once the object gets long enough, it gets awkward to put 了 at the end. The listener has to wait too long to find out if the verb already spoken has been completed or not. So save your listener the suspense; for long objects, it sounds more natural to put the 了 directly after the verb.<br><hr><br>- You may remember these from your original studies of 了 to indicate completion, but it's worth revisiting them to remind you that there are cases when you shouldn't move 了 to after the object, even when your verbs and objects are relatively short.<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Obj.<br>- When the following conditions are met, 了 is typically placed before the object, which completes the sentence and gives it a tone of completion.<br>- When the object has modifiers, such as anindication of quantityor an adjective, it's not weird to put 了 immediately after the verb.<br><ruby>他 买了一辆车 。<rt>Tā mǎi le yī liàng chē.</rt></ruby><br>He bought a car.<br><ruby>妈妈 做了很 多菜 。<rt>Māma zuò le hěn duō cài.</rt></ruby><br>Mom made many dishes.<br><ruby>她 穿了最 漂亮 的裙子 。<rt>Tā chuān le zuì piàoliang de qúnzi.</rt></ruby><br>She wore the most beautiful dress.<br><hr><br>- When time, place, manner, or purpose are specified in a sentence, 了 can be used immediately after the verbto indicate completion.<br><ruby>我昨天看了电影 。<rt>Wǒ zuótiān kàn le diànyǐng.</rt></ruby><br>I saw a movie yesterday.<br><ruby>我和 同事 一起吃了饭 。<rt>Wǒ hé tóngshì yīqǐ chī le fàn.</rt></ruby><br>I had dinner together with my colleagues.<br><ruby>我们在 动物园 和 熊猫拍了照 。<rt>Wǒmen zài dòngwùyuán hé xióngmāo pāi le zhào.</rt></ruby><br>We took photos with pandas in the zoo.<br><hr><br>- When the object has modifiers, such as anindication of quantityor an adjective, it's not weird to put 了 immediately after the verb.<br><hr><br>- 了 (le) can also indicate that one action is completed before another in thefuture, and this type of 了 is often placed directly after a verb with an object.<br>- In this case, 了 follows both the verbandthe object.<br>- If another 了 is added at the end of the sentence, implies that the number in front of the object isalreadya big number, and that this number could continue to grow.<br><ruby>他们 生了四 个孩子了。<rt>Tāmen shēng le sì gè háizi le.</rt></ruby><br>They've had four children already.<br><ruby>你 吃了五 个包子了。<rt>Nǐ chī le wǔ gè bāozi le.</rt></ruby><br>You've eaten five baozi already.<br><hr><br>- If there is another 了 placed at the end of the sentence, it can add astronger emphasisthat the actionwas alreadycompleted, in the same way we might say we 'didfinish the work' or 'alreadyfinished the work' instead of just saying we 'finished the work.'<br><ruby>我 做了作业了，你 要 检查 吗 ？<rt>Wǒ zuò le zuòyè le, nǐ yào jiǎnchá ma?</rt></ruby><br>I already finished my homework. Do you want to check it?<br><ruby>他 问了经理了，经理 说 行 。<rt>Tā wèn le jīnglǐ le, jīnglǐ shuō xíng.</rt></ruby><br>He already asked the manager, and the manager said yes.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG4K5WH		{}
Subj. + Verb + 了 + Complement<br>走了上去 。		- Advanced 'le' with complements<br>- You may have learned that 了 (le) follows immediately after a verb to indicate completion (AKA了1), and comes at the end of a sentence when it indicates a 'change of state' (AKA了2). But what about when a complement comes after the verb? Does that count as part of the verb or not? The answer, as it often is with 了, is 'it's complicated.'<br>- Both of these structures are possible, but the second one has fewer acceptable use cases.<br>- Subj. + Verb + Complement + 了<br>- Subj. + Verb + 了 + Complement<br>- The former is more common in informal speech, while the latter is more common in written language and is only used with certain types of complements.<br>- This is fine for most verb-complement structures. No real limits here.<br>- Some examples：<br><ruby>买到了。<rt>Mǎi  dào le.</rt></ruby><br>Purchased/bought.<br><ruby>做起来了。<rt>Zuò qǐlái  le.</rt></ruby><br>Produced/made.<br><ruby>吃完了。<rt>Chī  wán   le .</rt></ruby><br>Finished eating.<br><hr><br>- While you do NOT do this withresult complements(e.g. 完, 好, etc.), it is a very common structure withdirection complementsin written Chinese.<br>- Some examples：<br><ruby>站了起来<rt>Zhàn  le   qǐlái .</rt></ruby><br>stood up<br><ruby>走了上去<rt>Zǒu  le   shàngqù .</rt></ruby><br>walked upward to<br><ruby>吃了起来<rt>Chī  le   qǐlái .</rt></ruby><br>started eating<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG890CA		{}
Statement + 嘛<br>大家 有 话 就 说嘛。		- Marking a topic with 'ma'<br>- The particle 嘛 (ma) can be used for topic marking. It basically allows the speaker to state the topic, then gather his thoughts before making a comment on it. Unlikethe sentence-final 嘛 patternyou may know, the following commentmay or may notbe one the speaker feels is obvious.<br>- Topic + 嘛 ，Statement<br>- Translations for this pattern are going to be a bit looser than for many other grammar patterns.<br><ruby>大 熊猫嘛，大家 都 喜欢 。<rt>Dàxióngmāo ma, dàjiā dōu xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>Pandas. Everybody likes them.<br><ruby>名牌嘛，一定 不 便宜 。<rt>Míngpái ma, yīdìng bù piányi.</rt></ruby><br>Well, it's a name brand.

⋯⋯呢？<br>他 人 在 哪呢？		- Softening the tone of questions with 'ne'<br>- We have seen before that 吧 can be used tosoften the tone of statements,  ormake commands feel more like suggestions. 呢 works in same way, but it is used to make questions more indirect and uncertain in tone.<br>- 呢 can be used successively in questions using 还是.<br>- Option 1 + 呢 + 还是 + Option 2 + 呢？<br><ruby>我 去 缅甸呢，还是泰国呢？我 得 想 一 想！<rt>Wǒ qù Miǎndiàn ne, háishì Tàiguó ne? Wǒ děi xiǎng yi xiǎng!</rt></ruby><br>Should I go to Myanmar or Thailand?

I'm OK with either!<br><hr><br>- The example sentences above almost have a tone that the speaker is talking to him/herself, as the question is not directly asked of the listener. A second verb is only necessary if different from the first verb.<br>- Interrogative pronouns, of course, include 哪儿，谁，怎么，什么, 为什么, 什么时候, etc.<br>- ⋯⋯Interrogative Pronoun⋯⋯ + 呢？<br><ruby>这 是 谁 的 笔呢?<rt>Zhè shì shéi de bǐ ne?</rt></ruby><br>I wonder whose pen this is?<br><ruby>他 去 哪儿了 呢？<rt>Tā qù nǎr le ne?</rt></ruby><br>I wonder where he's going?<br><ruby>怎么 会呢？<rt>Zěnme huì ne?</rt></ruby><br>How could that be?<br><hr><br>- In the previous examples, the speaker has a tone of conjecture, a bit like saying 'I wonder' in English. Again, as in the first usage, the question is not directly asked of the listener. Overusing 呢 in your questions can sound a bit feminine, though, so keep this in mind.<br>- If a 'verb 不 verb' question is posedwithout呢, it can appear as though the speaker is a bit impatient, or is ordering the listener to do something. Tone of voice used is also an important factor here, and adding 呢 can give a tone of uncertainty, which sounds less demanding and more polite.<br>- Subj. + Verb 1 + 不 + Verb 1 + (Verb 2) + 呢？<br>- Remember: the exact meaning of the above sentences depends on the full context, and tone of voice is very important as well. The interpretations given are just possible examples.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGW7YXP		{}
级别 / 次序 / 数目 + 以上 / 以下<br>十 岁以下的 孩子 不用 买 票 。		- Defining upper and lower limits<br>- To specify 'more than' or 'less than' a certain amount, or 'within' a certain amount, you're going to want to use some of these common words: 以上 (yǐshàng), 以下 (yǐxià), 以内 (yǐnèi), and 以外 (yǐwài). All are 'nouns of locality,' or 方位词 in Chinese.<br>- 以上 and 以下 mean 'more than'/'above' and 'less than'/'below,' respectively. Generally they are non-inclusive, meaning that when you say 十岁以下 you mean 'less than ten years of age,' up to ten, but not including ten years old. In actual usage, however, this fine point may sometimes be fudged a little.<br>- Amount / Level + 以上 / 以下<br>- Literally, 以内 and 以外 mean 'within' and 'outside.' This spatial meaning can be extended to all kinds of abstracted meanings, as you will see below. Note that 以外 often combines with除了.<br>- [Amount / Time / Place / Scope] + 以内 / 以外<br><ruby>两 天以内必须 完成 。<rt>Liǎng tiān yǐnèi bìxū wánchéng.</rt></ruby><br>Must be completed within two days.<br><ruby>半 小时以内能 送到 吗 ？<rt>Bàn xiǎoshí yǐnèi néng sòng dào ma?</rt></ruby><br>Can you deliver in 30 minutes or less?<br><ruby>这个 大楼 50 米以内不 能 停车 。<rt>Zhège dàlóu wǔshí mǐ yǐnèi bù néng tíng chē.</rt></ruby><br>You cannot park within 50 meters of this building.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG7AE5C		{}

Subj. + 并 + 不 + Verb / Adj.<br>当 金融 分析 人员并不是 我 的 梦想。		- Emphasizing a negation with 'bing'<br>- One of the many uses of并(bìng) is to add emphasis to a negative sentence that uses不or没. Because you're emphasizing a negation, 并 is often used when expressing disagreement or pointing out a flaw in someone's argument. While the word 并 is not inherently combative, it can certainly be used that way.<br>- You can take pretty much any sentence with a negated verb and give it a little extra kick with 并. Just put it before the 不 or 没. Note that when used with 不, you can negate an adjective as well.<br>- Subj. + 并 + 不 + Verb / Adj.<br>- Subj. + 并 + 没（有) + Verb<br><ruby>在 中国 创业并不容易，有 很 多 的 挑战。<rt>Zài Zhōngguó chuàngyè bìng bù róngyì, yǒu hěn duō de tiǎozhàn.</rt></ruby><br>In China, starting a business really isn't easy.

But if the good outcome comes after 多亏, you need to add in 才 to indicate 'as a result...(the good outcome happened).' (才 gives the sense that the good outcomewouldn't have happenedwithout that extra help.)<br>- 多亏 (了) + [Lucky Incident] ，Subj. 才 + [Good Outcome]<br><ruby>多亏 了你 开车 送 我 ，我才没 迟到 。<rt>Duōkuī le nǐ kāichē sòng wǒ, wǒ cái méi chídào.</rt></ruby><br>Thanks to your ride, I'm not late to get here.<br><ruby>多亏你 的 伞 ，我才没 淋湿 。<rt>Duōkuī nǐ de sǎn, wǒ cái méi línshī.</rt></ruby><br>Thanks to your umbrella, I didn't get wet.<br><ruby>多亏你 帮 我，我才能 这么 快 做完 。<rt>Duōkuī nǐ bāng wǒ, wǒ cái néng zhème kuài zuò wán.</rt></ruby><br>Thanks to your help, I was able to complete it so quickly.<br><hr><br>- If you want to add in 不然 (bùrán) for an 'otherwise... (this really bad thing would have happened)' explanation, use this structure.<br>- 多亏 (了) + [Lucky Incident] ，不然 + [Bad Outcome]<br>- When translating to English, 'thanks to' doesn't always work as well when you have to add in 'otherwise.'<br><ruby>这 件 事情多亏 了你 的 提醒 ，不然我 肯定 忘 了 。<rt>Zhè jiàn shìqing duōkuī le nǐ de tíxǐng, bùrán wǒ kěndìng wàng le.</rt></ruby><br>Thank you for reminding me about this matter!

Verb + 什么 + Obj.<br>没有 钱 看什么电影。		- Challenging a verb with 'shenme'<br>- Adding 什么 (shénme) to the end of a verb can be used to change a sentence into arhetorical question.<br>- Just like in English, asking 'what are you looking at?' can be a rhetorical question (hinting that you should stop staring), but can also be a sincere inquiry about what exactly the other person is looking at. When you repeat the verb, though, you make it pretty clear that you're not just curious. You're so annoyed that you're asking a rhetorical question.<br>- Verb + 什么 + Verb ？<br><ruby>你买 什么 买，钱 都 花 光 了。<rt>Nǐ mǎi shénme mǎi, qián dōu huā guāng le.</rt></ruby><br>Buy what, now?

不如⋯⋯<br>我的 汉语不如他的。		- Comparisons with 'buru'<br>- 不如 (bùrú) can be used to make comparisons in a similar way as the比structure. In its simplest form 不如 is used to convey that A is “not as good as” B. Unlike the 比 structure, when used in this way, the adjective or verb can be omitted.<br>- A + 不如 + B<br><ruby>我 哥 的 成绩不如我的 。<rt>Wǒ gē de chéngjì bùrú wǒ de.</rt></ruby><br>My older brother's grades are not as good as mine.<br><ruby>看 电影不如看 原著 。<rt>Kàn diànyǐng bùrú kàn yuánzhù.</rt></ruby><br>Watching a movie isn't as good as reading the book.<br><ruby>他 总是 觉得 自己不如别人 。<rt>Tā zǒngshì juéde zìjǐ bùrú biérén.</rt></ruby><br>He always thinks he's not as good as other people.<br><hr><br>- When an adjective or verb is added to the structure it can then be used to mean A is not as 'adjective' as B, or A does not 'verb' as well as B:<br>- A + 不如 + B + Adj.<br>- A + Verb + 得 + 不如 + B + Adj.<br>- A + Verb-Obj. + 不如 + B+ (Verb + 得) + Adj.<br><ruby>这 件 裙子不如那 件 好看 。<rt>Zhè jiàn qúnzi bùrú nà jiàn hǎokàn.</rt></ruby><br>This dress doesn't look as good as that one.<br><ruby>那个 说法不如这个 说法 实用 。<rt>Nàge shuōfǎ bùrú zhège shuōfǎ shíyòng.</rt></ruby><br>This saying isn't as practical as that one.<br><ruby>他 穿 得不如你 好看 。<rt>Tā chuān de bùrú nǐ hǎokàn.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't dress as well as you do.<br><hr><br>- When facing a choice, 不如 can also be used to mean 'might as well' to emphasize that the choice that comes after 不如 is better than what was just being discussed.

Noun / Adj. + 化<br>KFC 的 中国 本土化经营 做 得 非常 成功。		- Making '-ize' and '-ify' verbs with 'hua'<br>- Thesuffix-化 (-huà) can be  added to the end of many Chinese words to make them into verbs, the equivalent of '-ize' or '-ify' in English.<br>- You can take some Chinesenounsandadjectivesand add a -化 to the end of them to '-ize' or '-ify' them. Basically, -化 takes the noun or adjective and makes it into a verb. One example of how we do that in English is to take the adjective 'modern' and add '-ize' to turn it into the verb 'modernize.' Most of the time, the Chinese words that -化 is added to are two-character words.<br>- Noun / Adj. + 化<br>- The following is a short list of -化 words and sentences. Note that while the suffix -化 most often corresponds to '-ize' or '-ify' in English, these are not theonlyoptions in English.

难怪 + Specific Person / People ……<br>难怪他，他还是个孩子呢，什么都不懂。		- Using 'nanguai' as a verb<br>- 难怪 (nán guài) can mean 'no wonder,' but when used as a verb can be translated as 'hard to blame,' a much more literal application. This phrase is usually directed at a person, and it is similar to how in English we may say, 'he's always sleepy, but you can't blame him because he works a night shift.'<br>- When used as a verb, 难怪 expresses that the speaker assigns no blame in the situation. Most often a person is placed after 难怪.<br>- 难怪 + [Specific Person / People] ……<br><ruby>他 迟到 了 ， 这 也难怪。 今天 地铁 坏 了 。<rt>Tā chídào le, zhè yě nánguài.

It's your first time in this place, and you aren't familiar with the local customs.<br><hr><br>- You can see how for some of these examples it wouldn't hard to use a 'no wonder' translation.

Subj. + 将 / 将要 / 将会 + Verb Phrase<br>比赛 结果将在 月底 公布 。		- Expressing future with 'jiang'<br>- 将 (jiāng) can be used to denote something is about to happen in the near future, similar to会, or 'will' in English. It is generally used in formal contexts.<br>- 将 is often combined with otherauxiliary verbslike 会 and 要, which doesn't significantly change the meaning.<br>- Subj. + 将 / 将要 / 将会 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>他将成为 一个 好 爸爸。<rt>Tā jiāng chéngwéi yī gè hǎo bàba.</rt></ruby><br>He will become a good father.<br><ruby>我将永远 记得 你 对 我 的 帮助。<rt>Wǒ jiāng yǒngyuǎn jìde nǐ duì wǒ de bāngzhù.</rt></ruby><br>I will forever remember the help you have given me.<br><ruby>这 次 世界杯将在 莫斯科 举行 。<rt>Zhè cì Shìjièbēi jiāng zài Mòsīkē jǔxíng.</rt></ruby><br>This World Cup will be held in Moscow.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGIQPUJ		{}
Verb Phrase 1 + 并 / 并且 + Verb Phrase 2<br>我 同意并且支持 你 的 决定 。		- Combining verbs with 'bing'<br>- 并 (bìng) can be used to connect verbs. In this structure the two verbs should be of equal importance.<br>- The verb phrases in the pattern below are often two-syllable verbs, and usually somewhat formal.<br>- In some cases, the two verb phrases on either side of 并 are of equal stress or importance. When 并 means 'moreover,' however, it can be replaced with并且.<br>- [Verb Phrase 1] + 并 + [Verb Phrase 2]<br>- Notice that 并且 is used with verbs, unlike和, which is used mostly with nouns.<br>- Here are some examples:<br><ruby>我 同意并支持 你 的 决定。<rt>Wǒ tóngyì bìng zhīchí nǐ de juédìng.</rt></ruby><br>I agree with and support your decision.<br><ruby>要 继续 保持并发扬 优秀 的 民族 传统。<rt>Yào jìxù bǎochí bìng fāyáng yōuxiù de mínzú chuántǒng.</rt></ruby><br>We will continue to maintain and carry forward our excellent national traditions.<br><ruby>会议 讨论并通过 了 今年 的 工作 计划。<rt>Huìyì tǎolùn bìng tōngguò le jīnnián de gōngzuò jìhuà.</rt></ruby><br>The meeting discussed and approved the work plan for this year.<br><hr><br>- Note that in some cases the English translation is awkward if we try to keep two actions fully 'parallel' rather than sequential.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5C89R		{}
由 + Person + Verb<br>这个 项目由小李 来 完成 。		- Emphasizing the doer of an action with 'you'<br>- 由 (yóu)  is used to emphasize who is the doer or initiator of an action, a bit like in English where we might say: 'Andyis the one who....'<br>- Topic + 由 + Person + Verb<br>- This use of 由 is common in formal contexts such as business communications.<br><ruby>这 件 事由我 说了算。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì yóu wǒ shuō le suàn.</rt></ruby><br>This matter is up to me.<br><ruby>这 件 事由我 负责。<rt>Zhè jiàn shì yóu wǒ fùzé.</rt></ruby><br>I am responsible for this matter.<br><ruby>这 件 事 是由她 引起 的。<rt>Zhèjiàn shì shì yóu tā yǐnqǐ de.</rt></ruby><br>The incident was caused by her.<br><hr><br>- It may seem like it due to the way most of these sentences are translated into English, but please note that 由 not a passive marker. Stick to被for that.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGGNXVR		{}
(Subj. +) 难免 + Verb Phrase<br>第 一 次 尝试 ，难免失败 。		- Expressing 'hard to avoid' with 'nanmian'<br>- 难免 (nánmiǎn) means 'to be unavoidable' or 'inevitable' and is most commonly placed before a verb phrase, often including an auxiliary verb such as 会 or 要. It is normally used to introduce an inevitable situation that is negative.<br>- (Subj. +) 难免 + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>刚 开始 说 外语 时难免会 有 一些 误会。<rt>Gāng kāishǐ shuō wàiyǔ shí nánmiǎn huì yǒu yīxiē wùhuì.</rt></ruby><br>When you first start speaking a foreign language, there are inevitably going to be some misunderstandings.<br><ruby>年轻 人难免会 遇到 挫折，关键 是 学习 怎么 克服。<rt>Niánqīng rén nánmiǎn huì yù dào cuòzhé, guānjiàn shì xuéxí zěnme kèfú.</rt></ruby><br>Young people can't avoid facing setbacks, but the most important thing is to learn how to overcome them.<br><ruby>第一 次 坐 飞机 出国难免会 有点 兴奋 。<rt>Dì-yī cì zuò fēijī chūguó nánmiǎn huì yǒudiǎn xīngfèn.</rt></ruby><br>There‘s no way to not feel excited about it the first time you get on a plane to go abroad.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGYDKT3		{}
Verb Phrase 1 + 并 / 并且 + Verb Phrase 2<br>我 同意并且支持 你 的 决定 。		- Expressing 'moreover' with 'bingqie'<br>- 并且 (bìngqiě) can be used to connect two verbs. In this structure the two verbs may be of equal importance (similar to并), but often the word 并且 is part of a longer pattern which adds in a meaning of 'moreover,' taking the idea expressed in the first part of the sentence even further.<br>- [Verb Phrase 1] + 并且 / 并 + [Verb Phrase 2]<br>- Notice that 并且 is most often used with verbs, unlike和, which is used mostly with nouns. It is rather formal.<br>- Foronlythis 并且 pattern, you can substitute并for 并且 and keep the same meaning.<br><ruby>我 同意并且支持 你 的 决定。<rt>Wǒ tóngyì bìngqiě zhīchí nǐ de juédìng.</rt></ruby><br>I agree with and support your decision.<br><ruby>我 会 帮 你 找到 问题并且解决 问题。<rt>Wǒ huì bāng nǐ zhǎodào wèntí bìngqiě jiějué wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>I can help you find the problem and also solve it.<br><ruby>你 要 编辑并且打印 这 个 文件。<rt>Nǐ yào biānjí bìngqiě dǎyìn zhège wénjiàn.</rt></ruby><br>You need to edit and also print out this document.<br><hr><br>- The meaning 'moreover' means that the second part of the sentence takes the idea in the first parteven further.<br>- [Verb Phrase 1] + 并且 + 也 / 还 + [Verb Phrase 2]<br>- You cannot substitute并for 并且 in this pattern.<br><ruby>你 要 按照 我 说 的 做并且也要 做 好。<rt>Nǐ yào ànzhào wǒ shuō de zuò bìngqiě yě yào zuò hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>I need you to do as I say and also do it well.<br><ruby>我们 需要 的 是 有 丰富 的 工作 经验并且也懂 得 团队 合作 的 员工。<rt>Wǒmen xūyào de shì yǒu fēngfù de gōngzuò jīngyàn bìngqiě yě dǒngdé tuánduì hézuò de yuángōng.</rt></ruby><br>What we need is an employee with rich work experience and also an understanding of teamwork.<br><ruby>我 通知 了 所有 的 人，并且还准备 了 所有 的 材料。<rt>Wǒ tōngzhī le suǒyǒu de rén, bìngqiě hái zhǔnbèi le suǒyǒu de cáiliào.</rt></ruby><br>I have informed everyone.

值得 + Verb<br>这个 想法 不错 ，值得考虑 。		- Expressing 'to be worth' doing with 'zhide'<br>- 值得 (zhídé) means 'to be worth'doingsomething, and is often placed before a verb or a verb phrase. Note that it is used to describe whether an action is worth it and cannot be used to state that something is worth a certain monetary value. For that 值 must be used on its own.<br>- 值得 + Verb / Verb Phrase<br><ruby>巴金 的 散文 很值得一 看 。<rt>Bājīn de sǎnwén hěn zhídé yī kàn.</rt></ruby><br> Ba Jin's prose deserves a look.<br><ruby>虽然 不 容易，但是值得去 尝试。<rt>Suīrán bù róngyì, dànshì zhídé qù chángshì.</rt></ruby><br>It's not easy, but it's worth a try.<br><ruby>雷锋 助人为乐 的 精神值得我们 学习。<rt>Léifēng zhùrénwéilè de jīngshén zhídé wǒmen xuéxí.</rt></ruby><br>The spirit of altruism merits some study.<br><hr><br>- 值得 can also be used as a predicate all by itself, or following a verb phrase.<br>- (Verb Phrase +) 值得<br><ruby>值得吗？值得。<rt>Zhídé ma?

害得 + Verb Phrase<br>老师 给 的 作业 太 难 了 ，害得我 浪费 了 一 个 下午 学习 。		- Indicating negative impact with 'haide'<br>- Used mostly in spoken Chinese, 害得 (hàide) can indicate that the speaker is now in some kind of trouble or undesirable situation, caused by someone or something else. There's a tone of blame or complaining when using this pattern.<br>- The reason for the trouble should be stated before 害得 (hàide). The 得 can also be omitted.<br>- Reason，害(得) + Undesirable Situation<br>- Keep in mind that 害得 can be tricky to translate directly. It's more a matter of conveying the tone of 'this is how you inconvenienced me' or 'this situation negatively impacted me.' You might see words like 'make' or 'force' or 'keep from' to communicate that tone.<br><ruby>下午 喝 了 两 杯 咖啡，害得我 晚上 睡 不 着。<rt>Xiàwǔ hē le liǎng bēi kāfēi, hàide wǒ wǎnshang shuì buzháo.</rt></ruby><br>I had two cups of coffee.

受 + Verb<br>他 为 人 善良 ， 很受尊重 。		- Passive verbs with 'shou'<br>- 受 (shòu) is generally thought of as a passive marker, converting the verb placed after it into the passive.

This explanation may be more accessible to native English speakers. However whichever grammatical explanation one uses, the meaning essentially remains the same.<br>- 受 (+ 到/过) + ([Something / Someone] +) Noun / Verb<br><ruby>张 老师 的 课受到了 很 多 学生 的欢迎。<rt>Zhāng Lǎoshī de kè shòudào le hěn duō xuéshēng de huānyíng.</rt></ruby><br>Teacher Zhang's lessons received many students' approval.<br><ruby>一 个 人 不一定 要 变得 很 有钱 或者 很 成功 才 会受人尊重。<rt>Yī gè rén bù yīdìng yào biàn de hěn yǒu qián huòzhě hěn chénggōng cái huì shòu rén zūnzhòng.</rt></ruby><br>A person doesn't have to be rich or successful to receive respect from other people.<br><ruby>我 父母 都 没受过很 好 的 教育。<rt>Wǒ fùmǔ dōu méi shòu guo hěn hǎo de jiàoyù.</rt></ruby><br>Neither of my parents has received a very good education.<br><hr><br>- It must be noted that on the occasions when 受 is followed immediately by 到 or 过，it is preferable to consider 受 as a verb.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1DXUD		{}
Verb + 着 + Verb + 着 + 就 + Comment + 了<br>走着走着， 他们 到 家 了 。		- Using 'zhe' when 'verbing away'<br>- A repeated verb followed by the particle 着 (zhe) is used to show that an action has been repeated for a period of time, and as a result a new situation has arisen which the speaker wishes to comment on.<br>- Verb + 着 + Verb + 着 + 就 + Comment + 了<br><ruby>说着说着我就发现 自己 也 糊涂了。<rt>Shuōzhe shuōzhe wǒ jiù fāxiàn zìjǐ yě hútu le.</rt></ruby><br>After talking and talking, I realized that I had confused myself.<br><ruby>我 今天 一直 都 在 看 《论语》，看着看着，就睡着了。<rt>Wǒ jīntiān yīzhí dōu zài kàn Lúnyǔ, kànzhe kànzhe, jiù shuìzháo le.</rt></ruby><br>Today, I was reading the Confucian Analects all day.

格外 + verb<br>他今天格外忙.		- Expressing 'especially' with 'gewai'<br>- 格外 (géwài) is anadverbthat has the same meaning as 'especially' or 'particularly' in English. You might be wondering what the difference between 格外 (géwài) and 特别 (tèbié) is. Keep in mind that 特别 (tèbié) can be either as anadjectivethat emphasizes something is 'special' or as an adverb that expresses 'especially.' However, 格外 (géwài) canonlybe an adverb that emphasizes 'especially' and cannot be used as an adjective like 特别 (tèbié) can.<br>- 格外 (地 +) + Advective / Psychological Verb<br>- You will occasionally see 地 (de) after 格外 and before an adjective.<br><ruby>下 过 雨 的 早晨格外舒服.<rt>Xià guo yǔ de zǎochén géwài shūfu.</rt></ruby><br>It's especially comfortable on mornings after a rain.<br><ruby>今天格外忙, 都 来不及 吃 午饭.<rt>Jīntiān géwài máng,dōu láibují chī wǔfàn.</rt></ruby><br>I was especially busy today and didn't even have time to eat lunch.<br><ruby>昨天 登山 累了, 晚上 睡得格外香甜 。<rt>Zuótiān dēngshān lèi le, wǎnshang shuì de géwài xiāngtián</rt></ruby><br>I was tired from climbing yesterday, so my sleep at night was especially sweet. <br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG87D22		{}
尽管⋯⋯，但是⋯⋯<br>尽管我 很 生气 ，但是我 没 发脾气 。		- Expressing 'although' with 'jinguan'<br>- 尽管 (jǐnguǎn)  means 'although,' and is a little stronger than虽然, perhaps more like 'despite' or 'even though' in English.<br>- 尽管⋯⋯ ，(可是 / 但是 +) Subj. + 还是⋯⋯<br>- 可是 or 但是 can be added to further emphasize the shift in meaning in the second phrase.<br><ruby>尽管很 多 人 批评 他 ，他还是坚持 这么 做。<rt>Jǐnguǎn hěn duō rén pīpíng tā, tā háishì jiānchí zhème zuò.</rt></ruby><br>Despite the fact that many people criticize him, he still insists on doing it.<br><ruby>尽管老板 最近 不 在 ，我们还是不 能 偷懒。<rt>Jǐnguǎn lǎobǎn zuìjìn bù zài, wǒmen háishì bù néng tōulǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Despite the fact that the boss hasn't been around lately, we still can't get lazy.<br><ruby>尽管困难 很 多 ，但是我们 不能 放弃。<rt>Jǐnguǎn kùnnan hěn duō, dànshì wǒmen bù néng fàngqì.</rt></ruby><br>Even though there are many difficulties, we can't just give up.<br><hr><br>- You may hear the word 尽管 pronounced as both 'jǐnguǎn' and 'jìnguǎn.' Although 'jǐnguǎn' is technically correct and 'jìnguǎn' is incorrect, many educated native speakers will pronounce 尽量 exclusively as 'jìnguǎn.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGW863F		{}
倒⋯⋯<br>雨 没有 停 ，倒大 起来 了 。		- Expressing contrariness with 'dao'<br>- 倒 (dào) can be used to express something is contrary to expectations, acting as a turning point in the sentence. It is generally followed by a positive comment.<br>- 倒 can be used to express an unexpected situation. Note that 倒 is often followed by 也 or 又 to add further emphasis.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，Subj. + 倒 +  (也 / 又) ⋯⋯<br>- Sometimes 'actually' works well in translations to indicate the contrast between expectation and reality.<br><ruby>我 帮 他，倒不 是 因为 喜欢 他，是 因为 他 工作 很 努力 。<rt>Wǒ bāng tā, dào bù shì yīnwèi xǐhuan tā, shì yīnwèi tā gōngzuò hěn nǔlì.</rt></ruby><br>I helped him not because I liked him, but because he worked very hard.<br><ruby>他 不 是 很 努力 ，成绩倒也 不错 。<rt>Tā bù shì hěn nǔlì, chéngjì dào yě bùcuò.</rt></ruby><br>He's not very hard-working, but his scores also aren't bad.<br><ruby>已经 是 春天 了，倒又 冷 起来 了。<rt>Yǐjīng shì chūntiān le, dào yòu lěng qǐlái le.</rt></ruby><br>It's already spring, but it's actually getting colder.<br><hr><br>- 倒 can also be used to express a concession, mostly emphasizing the positive side. 就是、但是、可是、不过 are often used to precede the undesirable reality the speaker is calling attention to.<br>- Subj. + 倒 ⋯⋯ ，不过 / 但是 / 就是 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>我倒是 想 去 旅游 ，但是现在 太 忙 了，没有 时间 。<rt>Wǒ dào shì xiǎng qù lǚyóu, dànshì xiànzài tài máng le, méiyǒu shíjiān.</rt></ruby><br>I do want to go on a trip, but I am too busy to do so now.<br><ruby>这 篇 文章 的 内容倒不错 ，就是太 长 了 。<rt>Zhè piān wénzhāng de nèiróng dào bùcuò, jiùshì tài cháng le.</rt></ruby><br>The content of this article is great, but it's just too long.<br><ruby>这 件 衣服 的 样式 和 大小倒都 合适 ，可是我 不 喜欢 这 个 颜色 。<rt>Zhè jiàn yīfu de yàngshì hé dàxiǎo dào dōu héshì, kěshì wǒ bù xǐhuan zhège yánsè.</rt></ruby><br>The style and size of this piece of clothing actually work well, but I don't like the color.<br><hr><br>- For more on倒, be sure to check our C1 grammar point on even moreadvanced uses of 倒.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG1RE80		{}
⋯⋯，反而 ⋯⋯<br>他 没有 放弃 ，反而更加 努力 了 ！		- Expressing 'on the contrary' with 'fan'er'<br>- 反而 (fǎn'ér) is used to express 'on the contrary' or 'in contrast,' with 反而 appearing as part of the second part of the sentence.  Note that the meaning of 反而 goes beyond just 'but' and is usually used to explain that something is totally the opposite of what one was expecting.<br>- Normally the first clause makes a statement, and then the second clause introduces the part that is totally opposite of one's expectations. The word 'actually' may be helpful in some translations.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，Subj. + 反而 + [Unexpected Outcome]<br>- It's also important to point out that 反而 is not aconjunction; it's anadverb.  Practically speaking, this means that rather than joining two statements, it goesinsidea statement (within the second clause). Specifically, it needs to comeafter the subject(if there is one) andbefore the verb.  (This is different from a conjunction like 但是 which comesbeforethe subject!) Also 反而 can appear in one sentence with 但是. Rather thanreplacingit, 反而 can workwith但是 to add even more contrarian emphasis.<br><ruby>吃 了 这个 药 ，病反而更 严重 了。<rt>Chī le zhège yào, bìng fǎn'ér gèng yánzhòng le.</rt></ruby><br>After taking the medicine, the illness actually got even worse.<br><ruby>这个 新 系统反而降低 了 我们 的 工作 效率 。<rt>Zhège xīn xìtǒng fǎn'ér jiàngdī le wǒmen de gōngzuò xiàolǜ.</rt></ruby><br>This new system actually reduced our work efficiency.<br><ruby>他 没有 放弃 ，反而更 努力 了 ！<rt>Tā méiyǒu fàngqì, fǎn'ér gèng nǔlì le!</rt></ruby><br>He didn't give up; on the contrary, he worked even harder.<br><hr><br>- Take note: when the subject of the first and second clause are the same, the subject can be omitted in the second clause (after the comma and before 反而). If thereisa subject, however, 反而 definitely needs to comeafterit. See the simple examples below and then check the longer sentences above, confirming this rule.<br><hr><br>- Adding不但or不仅adds a sense of 'not only' before the 'to the contrary' part. The word 'actually' can be useful here for translations into English.<br>- ⋯⋯ ，Subj. [不但 / 不仅] + [不 / 没] ⋯⋯，反而 + [Unexpected Outcome]<br><ruby>吃 了 药 ，病不但 没好，反而更 严重 了。<rt>Chī le yào, bìng bùdàn méi hǎo, fǎn'ér gèng yánzhòng le.</rt></ruby><br>After taking the medicine, the illness not only didn't get better, but actually got even worse.<br><ruby>失败 了 这么 多 次 ，他不但 没放弃 ，反而更 努力 了。<rt>Shībài le zhème duō cì, tā bùdàn méi fàngqì, fǎn'ér gèng nǔlì le.</rt></ruby><br>Having failed so many times, he not only didn't give up, but rather worked even harder.<br><ruby>他不但 不帮 我 ，反而给 我 找 麻烦 。<rt>Tā bùdàn bù bāng wǒ, fǎn'ér gěi wǒ zhǎo máfan.</rt></ruby><br>He not only didn't help me, but rather gave me trouble.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGX5QTV		{}
⋯⋯，却⋯⋯<br>他们 一见钟情 ，却没有 在 一起 。		- The 'however' adverb 'que'<br>- 却 (què) is used to indicate something was contrary to expectations, and is used in a similar way to倒 (dào). However, 却 is generally followed by a negative comment.<br>- The overall structure of sentences that use 却 is something like this:<br>- Sentence ，(但是 +) Subj. + 却 ⋯⋯<br>- Normally the first clause above makes a statement, and then the second clause introduces something contrary, generally in the form of a negative comment.<br>- In the following examples, take note that 却 comesafterthe subject in each case, and that it can be used together with 但是.<br><ruby>他 是 老板 ，却没有 人 听 他 的 。<rt>Tā shì lǎobǎn, què méiyǒu rén tīng tā de.</rt></ruby><br>He's the boss, but nobody listens to him.<br><ruby>他 的 学历 很 高 ，能力却很 一般 。<rt>Tā de xuélì hěn gāo, nénglì què hěn yībān.</rt></ruby><br>He's very well-educated, but his ability is average.<br><ruby>他们 一见钟情 ，却没有 在 一起 。<rt>Tāmen yījiànzhōngqíng, què méiyǒu zài yīqǐ.</rt></ruby><br>They fell in love at first sight, but they didn't end up with each other.<br><hr><br>- It's also important to point out that 却 is not aconjunction; it's anadverb.  Practically speaking, this means that rather than joining two statements, it goesinsidea statement (within the second clause).  Specifically, it needs to comeafter the subjectandbefore the verb.  (Note that when you use a conjunction like 但是 it comesbeforethe subject!  却 is different in this respect.  Also, rather thanreplacing但是, it can workwithit to add emphasis.)<br>- Sometimes the subject of the second clause will be omitted. If there is a subject, however, 却 definitely needs to comeafterit.<br>- A few examples to give you a better understanding of this:<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEG2QB		{}

It is used like this:<br>- This construction is not generally used to express a result, but more of a suggestion or inference deduced from the first fact. It can be placed before or after the subject.

Verb + 得了 / 不了<br>今晚 我 有事 ，去不 了。		- Advanced potential complements<br>- You may have a handle on the typicalpotential complements, but there are a few other fairly common ones that you still need to master. Each is addressed separately here, but for all of them, the preceding character 得 (de) or 不 (bu) is pronounced in theneutral tone.<br>- This pattern is used to talk about whether or not you are able to do something.

Verb + 起来<br>宝宝，你 应该 把 你 的 玩具收起来。		- Advanced uses of direction complement '-qilai'<br>- We have seen before that 起来 (qǐlái), among other things, can beused to express a literal upward movement. 起来 also has some less intuitive usages, which are figurative extensions of the 'movement' idea. For example, 起来 can be used to express collecting things together, sort of like in English we might say 'tidy up,' or 'gather up.'<br>- Verb + 起来<br>- Note that you will often see this pattern used with 把 sentence.<br>- Subj. + 把 + Obj. + Verb + 起来<br>- These examples are all more literal cases of bringing physical things together is some way.<br><ruby>13 和 15加起来是 多少 ？<rt>Shísān hé shíwǔ jiā qǐlái shì duōshǎo?</rt></ruby><br>How much are 13 and 15 added up?<br><ruby>他把衣服 都收起来了 。<rt>Tā bǎ yīfu dōu shōu qǐlái le.</rt></ruby><br>He put away the clothes.<br><ruby>我 老婆把钱 都存起来了 。<rt>Wǒ lǎopo bǎ qián dōu cún qǐlái le.</rt></ruby><br>My wife saves all our money.<br><hr><br>- 起来 can also be used to express more abstract concepts of bringing things together.<br><ruby>这 两 个 颜色搭配起来很 漂亮 。<rt>Zhè liǎng gè yánsè dāpèi qǐlái hěn piàoliang.</rt></ruby><br>These two colors look great when you combine them.<br><ruby>如果 我们团结起来，一定 能 赢 。<rt>Rúguǒ wǒmen tuánjié qǐlái, yīdìng néng yíng.</rt></ruby><br>We will absolutely win this if we band together.<br><ruby>如果 你把工作 和 兴趣结合起来，工作 就 会 很 快乐 。<rt>Rúguǒ nǐ bǎ gōngzuò hé xìngqù jiéhé qǐlái, gōngzuò jiù huì hěn kuàilè.</rt></ruby><br> If you combine your work with your interests, working will be fun.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGSCN01		{}
Verb + 坏了<br>坏了。		- Complement '-huai le'<br>- Thedegree complement-坏了 (huài le) is a bit like the complement-死了, and can be used to mean 'extremely' in  both a a positive and a negative sense.<br>- Adj. + 坏了<br>- As with many other grammar patterns, both adjectives andpsychological verbswork in this pattern.<br>- In these examples, the state is negative or undesirable, so is a natural fit for -坏了.<br><ruby>大家 都累坏了。<rt>Dàjiā dōu lèi huài le.</rt></ruby><br>Everyone was dead-tired.<br><ruby>我 早饭 和 中饭 都 没 吃 ，饿坏了。<rt>Wǒ zǎofàn hé zhōngfàn dōu méi chī, è huài le.</rt></ruby><br>I didn't eat anything for breakfast or lunch.

Verb + 着<br>宝宝 刚 睡着。		- Complement '-zhao'<br>- When used as a resultative complement, -着 (zháo) expresses that the action has reached its purpose or has had an outcome. It can also be used as a potential complement, meaning 'able to.'<br>- All you have to do is put -着 after the verb. Remember that it should be something that you can reach or achieve. It could be a purpose, or it can be producing an outcome or an influence.<br>- Verb + 着<br>- Remember: that 着 is pronounced 'zháoandnot'zhe'!<br><ruby>宝宝 刚睡着。<rt>Bǎobao gāng shuìzháo.</rt></ruby><br>The baby just fell asleep.<br><ruby>你 的 手机找着了 吗？<rt>Nǐ de shǒujī zhǎozháo le ma?</rt></ruby><br>Did you find your cell phone?<br><ruby>超市 关门 了 ，你 要 的 东西 我 没买着。<rt>Chāoshì guānmén le, nǐ yào de dōngxi wǒ méi mǎizháo.</rt></ruby><br>The supermarket is closed. I didn't buy things that you need.<br><hr><br>- You might be wondering: 'why the heck would I use this instead of到?' Hey, excellent question... we like the way you think! But native speakersdouse 着 fairly often (especially in the north), so it's something you need to know. Also, 睡着 (shuì zháo), meaning 'fall asleep,' is an exception in that it isincorrectto say *睡到 to mean 'fall asleep.'<br>- Verb + 得着 / 不着<br>- When used with 得 or 不, 着 functions as apotential complement, and denotes that one's one's ability is up (or not) to the task in question.<br><ruby>现在买不 着这样 的 衣服 了。<rt>Xiànzài mǎi buzháo zhèyàng de yīfu le.</rt></ruby><br>You can't buy such clothes now.<br><ruby>晚上 我睡不 着的 时候 就 看书。<rt>Wǎnshang wǒ shuì buzháo de shíhou jiù kànshū.</rt></ruby><br>At night when can't get to sleep, I read a book.<br><ruby>我 的 手机找不 着了。<rt>Wǒ de shǒujī zhǎo buzháo le.</rt></ruby><br>I can't find my cell phone.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGM5ZAB		{}
Verb + 到<br>他 做到了 吗 ？		- Tricky uses of 'dao'<br>- You probably learned theresult complement-到 a long time ago, as part of words like 看到 ('to see') and 听到 ('to hear'). But other times it's less clear what the -到 really means. Like the difference between 买 and 买到 or 做 and 做到. What -到 adds is a clearer message thatsomething has really been achieved.<br>- Adding -到 after a verb makes it very clear that the desired result was achieved. If you looked and you saw, then 到 indicates that. On the other hand, not adding 到 makes it unclear whether or not the desired result was achieved. It can have the effect of making a verb mean 'try toverb.'  So 做 without -到 is kind of like 'try to do,' but when you want to make it very clear that resultswere achievedormust be achieved, that's when you want to add -到.<br>- Let's look at another example. The difference between 找 and 找到 is that 找 means 'to search' (in other words, 'totryto find'), whereas 找到 means 'tofind,' that the search was successful, and results were achieved. So if one were to say '你一定要找,' it would mean 'you must try to find it' and '你一定要找到' means 'you mustfindit.'<br>- It's often assumed that if you're going to 做 something, it'll be to completion. But if there's ever any doubt, or a situation where 'to completion' needs to be made crystal clear, use 做到.<br><ruby>我 还 没有做。<rt>Wǒ hái méiyǒu zuò.</rt></ruby><br>I haven‘t done it.<br><ruby>我 下 个 星期 可以做。<rt>Wǒ xià gè xīngqī kěyǐ zuò.</rt></ruby><br>I can do it next week.<br><ruby>我 相信 你 一定 能做到。<rt>Wǒ xiāngxìn nǐ yīdìng néng zuòdào.</rt></ruby><br>I believe you will be able to do it.<br><hr><br>- 买 is another one where success is normally assumed, but every now and then it's not so easy to just buy something. That's where 买到 comes in handy.<br><ruby>我 还 没有买。<rt>Wǒ hái méiyǒu mǎi.</rt></ruby><br>I haven't bought it yet.<br><ruby>我 没买到。<rt>Wǒ méi mǎidào.</rt></ruby><br>I wasn't able to buy it.<br><ruby>这里买不 到进口 食品 。<rt>Zhèlǐ mǎibu dào jìnkǒu shípǐn.</rt></ruby><br>You can't buy imported good here.<br><hr><br>- You know how when you're studying, you know information is going into your brain, but you're not sure how well it's really sticking? Well, when you're sure of what's stuck, you can use 学到.<br><ruby>我 想学中文 。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng xué Zhōngwén.</rt></ruby><br>I want to study Chinese.<br><ruby>我们 今天学了 很 多 生词 。<rt>Wǒmen jīntiān xué le hěn duō shēngcí.</rt></ruby><br>Today we studied many new words.<br><ruby>在 这个 公司 工作 ，我学到了 很 多 东西。<rt>Zài zhège gōngsī gōngzuò, wǒ xuédào le hěn duō dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>Working for this company, I learned a lot of things.<br><hr><br>- A simple act of physically picking something up or taking something usually involves 拿. When the object becomes some kind of hard-to-get document, however, 拿到 is useful.<br><ruby>你拿小包 ，我拿大包 。<rt>Nǐ ná xiǎo bāo, wǒ ná dà bāo.</rt></ruby><br>You take the small bag, I'll take the big bag.<br><ruby>不 知道 什么 时候 能拿到我 的 工作 签证 。<rt>Bù zhīdào shénme shíhou néng nádào wǒ de gōngzuò qiānzhèng.</rt></ruby><br>I'm not sure when I'll be able to get my work visa.<br><ruby>如果 他拿不 到绿卡 ，我 就 跟 他 分手 。<rt>Rúguǒ tā ná bu dào lǜkǎ, wǒ jiù gēn tā fēnshǒu.</rt></ruby><br>If he can't get a green card, I will break up with him.<br><hr><br>- If you think of 想 as 'looking for ideas,' then 想 and 想到 are very similar to 找 and 找到. One difference, though, is that 没想到 means 'never imagined.' It's not that you tried to think of something and failed, it's just that the idea never occurred to you.<br><ruby>一定 要想一  个办法 。<rt>Yīdìng yào xiǎng yī gè bànfǎ.</rt></ruby><br>You have to think of a way.<br><ruby>你想到了 什么 好 办法 ？<rt>Nǐ xiǎngdào le shénme hǎo bànfǎ?</rt></ruby><br>Have you thought of anything good yet?<br><ruby>我们 都 没想到他 这么 生气 。<rt>Wǒmen dōu méi xiǎngdào tā zhème shēngqì.</rt></ruby><br>None of us imagined that he would be so mad.<br><hr><br>- This one is tricky, because 'pursue' is a metaphor, and there's no obvious result. 'Catch' sounds way too misogynistic and old-fashioned. 追到 actually involves more than just effort on the part of the pursuer; you have to move the girl's (or guy's) heart.<br><ruby>怎么追女孩子 ？<rt>Zěnme zhuī nǚ háizi?</rt></ruby><br>How do you pursue a  girl?<br><ruby>那 个 女孩子 ，你追到了吗 ？<rt>Nàge nǚháizi, nǐ zhuīdào le ma?</rt></ruby><br> That girl, did you win her over yet?<br><ruby>如果 你追到她 了 ，我 就 请 你 喝酒 。<rt>Rúguǒ nǐ zhuīdào tā le, wǒ jiù qǐng nǐ hējiǔ.</rt></ruby><br>If you can really win her over, I'll treat you to drinks.<br><hr><br>- 了解 indicates some kind of deep understanding, often one that only comes over a long period of time. But if you suddenly get some new in-depth information, 了解到 may be appropriate.<br><ruby>我 不 太了解这个 人 。<rt>Wǒ bù tài liǎojiě zhège rén.</rt></ruby><br>I don't really know this person well.<br><ruby>我们 刚刚了解到一些 新 的 消息 。<rt>Wǒmen gānggāng liǎojiě dào yīxiē xīn de xiāoxī.</rt></ruby><br>We just acquired some new information.<br><ruby>从 他 那里 ，我了解到了 真相 。<rt>Cóng tā nàlǐ, wǒ liǎojiě dào le zhēnxiàng.</rt></ruby><br>I learned the real truth of the matter from him.<br><hr><br>- You can think of 联系 as 'initiate contact' and 联系到 as 'establish contact.'<br><ruby>我们 怎么联系？<rt>Wǒmen zěnme liánxì?</rt></ruby><br>How do we get in contact?<br><ruby>你 知道 他 的联系方式 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ zhīdào tā de liánxì fāngshì ma?</rt></ruby><br>Do you have his contact information?<br><ruby>我 想 跟 你联系，但是 一直联系不 到你 。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng gēn nǐ liánxì, dànshì yīzhí liánxì bu dào nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I wanted to get in touch with you, but could never reach you.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGCUSIV		{}
Verb + 来 + Verb + 去<br>他 考虑来考虑去， 最后 还是 决定 回 学校 。		- Using 'lai' and 'qu' when 'verbing around'<br>- This structure can be used if want to say you are 'verbing without a clear direction.'  It's sort of like 'verbing this way and that.' The same verb is repeated before the 来 (lái) and 去 (qù). So for example, 走来走去 is a bit like 'walking here and there' or 'walking this way and that.'<br>- Verb + 来 + Verb + 去<br>- The same verb should repeat in this pattern. Single-syllable verbs are most common.<br>- In a sentence, this structure looks like this:<br><ruby>学生们 都 很 紧张，在 考场 外面走 来 走 去。<rt>Xuéshēng men dōu hěn jǐnzhāng, zài kǎochǎng wàimiàn zǒu lái zǒu qù.</rt></ruby><br>The students are all nervous, they are all pacing back and forth outside of the exam room.<br><ruby>他说 来 说 去还 不 承认 自己 错 了。<rt>Tā shuō lái shuō qù hái bù chéngrèn zìjǐ cuò le.</rt></ruby><br>He's been yakking a lot, but he still hasn't admitted that he's wrong.<br><ruby>我想 来 想 去都 想 不 明白，他 怎么 能 那样 对 我？<rt>Wǒ xiǎng lái xiǎng qù dōu xiǎng bù míngbai, tā zěnme néng nàyàng duì wǒ?</rt></ruby><br>I've thought and thought about it, but I can't understand, how could you treat me like that?<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGYJQAG		{}
只要⋯⋯，就⋯⋯<br>只要你 过来 ， 我们就很 开心 。		- Expressing 'as long as' with 'zhiyao'<br>- 只要……就…… (zhǐyào... jiù...) means 'as long as... then....' In other words,wheneverA happens, B (always) results.<br>- Use this structure to express that 'as long as' [something happens], 'then' [something else will happen].  In logic, this is referred to as a 'sufficient condition,' meaning that it may not be theonly wayto bring about the these specific consequences, but it isone reliable way.<br>- 只要 + Condition ，就 + Result<br><ruby>只要你 真的 喜欢， 我就给 你 买 。<rt>Zhǐyào nǐ zhēnde xǐhuan, wǒ  jiù gěi nǐ mǎi.</rt></ruby><br>As long as you really like it, I will buy it for you.<br><ruby>只要你 努力 学习，就会 有 进步 。<rt>Zhǐyào nǐ nǔlì xuéxí,  jiù huì yǒu jìnbù.</rt></ruby><br>As long as you study hard, you'll make progress.<br><ruby>只要有 你 在， 我就放心 了 。<rt>Zhǐyào yǒu nǐ zài, wǒ  jiù fàngxīn le.</rt></ruby><br>As long as you are here, I won't be worried.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG98C1A		{}
一旦⋯⋯，就⋯⋯<br>一旦我 找 好 的 工作，我 就 会 安心。		- Expressing 'once...then...' with 'yidan...jiu...'<br>- 一旦 (yīdàn) is used to express what would happen after a certain condition is met. Usually it is used with 就. This grammar pattern expresses that 'once' one thing happens, 'then' something else will happen.<br>- This structure is similar to the English 'once... then,' as in 'once I get my hands on you, you'll wish you'd never been born.'<br>- 一旦 + Condition，Subj. + 就 + Consequence<br><ruby>一旦发生 事故，你 要 负责！<rt>Yīdàn fāshēng shìgù, nǐ yào fùzé!</rt></ruby><br>In case of an accident, you're responsible!<br><ruby>有些 人一旦有 了 钱，就变了。<rt>Yǒuxiē rén yīdàn yǒu le qián, jiù biàn le.</rt></ruby><br>Some people change as soon as they have money.<br><ruby>一旦你 的 公司 上市，你就可以 变成 有钱人。<rt>Yīdàn nǐ de gōngsī shàngshì, nǐ jiù kěyǐ biànchéng yǒuqiánrén.</rt></ruby><br>Once your company goes public, you'll be a rich man.<br><hr><br>- Notice that in a few of the examples there is no 就. Sometimes you can leave out the 就 and the context that the result will happen is pretty clear.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGU3ZV1		{}
⋯⋯，才⋯⋯<br>那 本 书 我 看 了 两 遍才看 懂。		- Expressing 'only after' with 'cai'<br>- These patterns using 才 are loosely related, and revolve around a meaning of 'only when,' 'only after,' 'only then,' or 'not until.' They suggest a condition without stating the condition as explicitly as in thepattern 只有……才…….<br>- ⋯⋯ ，才 ⋯⋯<br>- In these examples, you'll notice that the first half of the sentence involves some kind of 'difficulty,' usually involving spending a lot of time, money, or effort. The second half tells what was finally achieved after spending all that time, money, or effort. The English translation which tends to work most reliably for these sentences is 'only after,' but multiple translations are possible.<br><ruby>我 花 了 八 千 块才买 到 了 旅游 的 东西。<rt>Wǒ huā le bā qiān kuài cái mǎi dào le lǚyóu de dōngxi.</rt></ruby><br>Only after spending 8000 RMB was I able to buy all the things for the trip.<br><ruby>小明 花 了 很 多 心思才设计 出 了 这 张 海报。<rt>Xiǎo Míng huā le hěn duō xīnsi cái shèjì chū le zhè zhāng hǎibào.</rt></ruby><br>Only after putting a lot of thought into it was Xiao Ming able to design this poster.<br><ruby>他 用 了 很 多 年才原谅 了 他的 妈妈。<rt>Tā yòng le hěn duō nián cái yuánliàng le tā de māma.</rt></ruby><br>Only after many years was he able to forgive his mom.<br><hr><br>- Note that for each of these examples, events havealready occurred. The fuller只有……才…… patternis more appropriate for the future or for hypothetical situations.<br>- This use of才is quite similar to the才 used to express lateness. The two sort of blend together.<br>- ⋯⋯，才⋯⋯<br>- ⋯⋯ ，才 ⋯⋯<br>- Note that rather than following a set pattern, the English translation sentences below make use of a number of different translations. 'Not until,' 'didn't... until,' 'only then,' and 'only after' may all be appropriate, depending on the context of the original Chinese.<br><ruby>她 做 完 了 功课才睡觉。<rt>Tā zuò wán le gōngkè cái shuìjiào.</rt></ruby><br>Not until she finished her homework did she go to sleep.<br><ruby>他 锁 上 了 门才想起来 没有 带 钥匙。<rt>Tā suǒ shàng le mén cái xiǎng qǐlái méiyǒu dài yàoshi.</rt></ruby><br>He didn't realize he had forgotten to bring his key until after he had locked the door.<br><ruby>我 把 牛奶 喝 完 了，才发现 牛奶 过期 了。<rt>Wǒ bǎ niúnǎi hē wán le, cái fāxiàn niúnǎi guòqī le.</rt></ruby><br>I finished off the milk, and only then did I discover that it was expired.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG9E9A6		{}
只有⋯⋯，才⋯⋯<br>只有你 帮忙 ， 我才能 完成 任务 。		- Expressing 'only if' with 'zhiyou'<br>- 只有 (zhǐyǒu) means 'only if,' and is used with 才 (cái) to emphasize thatonly onecourse of action will bring about the desired outcome.<br>- 只有 + Essential Condition + 才 (能) + Desired Outcome<br>- Note that 才 is often followed by 能, but not always. This pattern is usually used for hypothetical situations, and is used what is in logic called a 'necessary and sufficient condition,' meaning 'if and only if....'<br><ruby>只有努力才能 做 好 工作。<rt>Zhǐyǒu nǔlì cái néng zuò hǎo gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>Only if you work hard is it possible to do a good job.<br><ruby>只有多 吃饭才能 长高。<rt>Zhǐyǒu duō chīfàn cái néng zhǎng gāo.</rt></ruby><br>Only if you eat more will you be able to grow tall.<br><ruby>只有多 说，你的 中文才会 提高。<rt>Zhǐyǒu duō shuō, nǐ de Zhōngwén cái huì tígāo.</rt></ruby><br>Only if you speak more will your Chinese improve.<br><hr><br>- Note that for each of these examples, events havenotalready occurred. If they have, consider using the'only after' 才 patternwhich doesn't use 只有.<br>- This is one of the simpler才patterns, providing a way to emphasize that it'sTHISone (notTHAT one). There's no 'only if' here, but the 只有 is still implied in Chinese (meaning 'it is only'). While this pattern has many uses, one of the most common (and most childish) is as a not-so-witty comeback, in the form of, 'no,YOUare!'<br>- Noun + 才 + Verb Phrase⋯⋯<br><ruby>你才 是笨蛋 ！<rt>Nǐ cái shì bèndàn!</rt></ruby><br>YOU're the idiot!<br><ruby>在 某些 西方 国家 里 ， 白人才 是真正 的 西方人 。 我 不 同意 。<rt>Zài mǒuxiē xīfāng guójiā lǐ, báirén  cái shì  zhēnzhèng de xīfāngrén.

除非⋯⋯ ，才⋯⋯<br>除非你 求情 ，他才肯 帮忙 。		- Expressing 'unless' with 'chufei'<br>- 除非 (chúfēi) can be used as a conjunction and means 'unless.' 否则 (fǒuzé) or 要不然 (yàobùrán) often appear in the following phrase, to form a construction meaning 'unlessx,otherwisey':<br>- The simplified construction more directly maps to the basic English usage of 'unless,' as in, 'I won't do itunlessyou pay me.'<br>- Result / Fact ，除非 + Condition<br>- The sentences below place emphasis on the part after 除非.<br><ruby>我 不 去 ，除非你 也 去 。<rt>Wǒ bù qù, chúfēi nǐ yě qù.</rt></ruby><br>I won't go unless you go too.<br><ruby>你 不能 进 ，除非你 有 预约 。<rt>Nǐ bù néng jìn, chúfēi nǐ yǒu yùyuē.</rt></ruby><br>You can't come in unless you have an appointment.<br><ruby>我 不 说 ，除非你 答应 我 你 不会 生气 。<rt>Wǒ bù shuō, chúfēi nǐ dāyìng wǒ nǐ bù huì shēngqì.</rt></ruby><br>I won't tell you unless you promise me you won't get upset.<br><hr><br>- This simplified construction using 要不然 (or 不然) more directly maps to the basic English usage of 'otherwise,' as in: 'Pay me.

It might be more helpful to think of 除非 here as meaning 'only if.'<br>- 除非 x，才 y<br>- So that's 'Only ifx, y.'<br>- A few examples:<br><ruby>除非你们 买 很 多 ，才能 便宜 点 。<rt>Chúfēi nǐmen mǎi hěn duō, cái néng piányí diǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Only if you buy a lot can I give you a cheaper price.<br><ruby>除非旧 的 坏 了 ，我才会 买 新的 。<rt>Chúfēi jiù de huài le, wǒ cái huì mǎi xīn de.</rt></ruby><br>Only if the old one is broken will I buy a new one.<br><ruby>除非老板 给 我 加薪 ，我才会 留下来 。<rt>Chúfēi lǎobǎn gěi wǒ jiā xīn, wǒ cái huì liú xiàlái.</rt></ruby><br>Only if the boss gives me a pay raise will I stay.<br><hr><br>- This use of 才 is similar to the'only after' use.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGMD0YY		{}

哪怕⋯⋯，也⋯⋯<br>哪怕第 一 次 失败 了 ，也要 继续 研究 。		- Expressing 'even if…' with 'napa'<br>- 哪怕 (nǎpà) means 'even if,' and has a slightly stronger tone than即使or就算.

要是⋯⋯，就⋯⋯<br>你要是真 想 我，就给 我 打 电话 。		- Expressing 'if… then…' with 'yaoshi'<br>- 要是⋯⋯，就⋯⋯ (yàoshi..., jiù...) is one of several ways to convey 'If..., then...' It is very similar to如果..., 就...in usage and formality. However, it is important to note that 要是 is considered to be even more informal (and is usually left more to spoken Chinese) thanthe common 如果and used more frequently in the northern areas of China.<br>- 要是 + Subj. ⋯⋯ ， 就 ⋯⋯<br>- Note that the subject can also be placed before 要是.

It's most often used to bring up undesirable situations.<br>- 万一 is used for a usually undesirable possibility which the speaker considers highly unlikely. It's often a rhetorical question. (In other words, the speaker is saying, 'if this happens, you're screwed.')<br>- There are two common ways to use it in a question:<br>- 万一 ⋯⋯ 怎么办 ？<br>- 万一 ⋯⋯ 呢 ？<br>- Note that 万一 can go before or after thesubjectof a sentence.<br>- This use of 万一 has the same basic meaning as in a statement, but because it's a question, there's no solution offered.<br><ruby>万一我 父母 不 同意 呢 ？<rt>Wànyī wǒ fùmǔ bù tóngyì ne? </rt></ruby><br>What if my parents disapprove?<br><ruby>万一被 发现 了 怎么办 ？<rt> Wànyī bèi fāxiàn le zěnme bàn?</rt></ruby><br>What if we get caught?<br><ruby>带 着 伞 吧 ，万一下雨 呢 ？<rt>Dài zhe sǎn ba, wàn yī xiàyǔ ne?</rt></ruby><br>Take an umbrella.

But it can also be used to simply identify a topic, sort of like saying 'when it comes to....'<br>- 的话 can also be used to introduce a topic which the speaker intends to say more about.<br>- Topic + 的话 ，Comment<br>- Sometimes it's a fine line between an 'if' statement and an 'as for...' statement, as you'll see in some of the sentences below.<br><ruby>北京的话，秋天 去 最好 。<rt>Běijīng dehuà, qiūtiān qù zuì hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>As for Beijing, autumn is the best time to go.<br><ruby>晚上的话，当然 方便 啦 。<rt>Wǎnshang dehuà, dāngrán fāngbiàn la.</rt></ruby><br>The evening?

无论 / 不论⋯⋯，都 / 也⋯⋯<br>无论天 多 热 ，都要 坚持 。		- Expressing 'no matter' with 'wulun'<br>- 无论 (wúlùn)  means 'no matter,' and is generally used in the first part of the sentence. As with many other constructions, 都 and 也 can be used in the second part of the sentence to emphasize the action or decision will not change. It is more formal than不管.<br>- 无论 + Circumstances + 都 / 也 + Inevitable Result<br>- Note that 不论 (bùlùn) is equivalent to 无论 for this pattern.<br>- Because 无论 means 'no matter,' the clause that follows 无论 is going to include phrases such as 'how hard you try' or 'wherever you go,' and thus will normally include interrogative pronouns such as 怎么, 多(么), 什么, 谁, etc.<br><ruby>无论多么 成功，他总觉得 自己 不够 好。<rt>Wúlùn duōme chénggōng, tā zǒng juéde zìjǐ bù gòu hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>No matter how successful he is, he always thinks he isn't enough.<br><ruby>无论你 到 哪儿 我都会 跟着 你。<rt>Wúlùn nǐ dào nǎr wǒ dōu huì gēnzhe nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>Wherever you go, I will follow you.<br><ruby>无论你 说 还是 不 说，结果都一样。<rt>Wúlùn nǐ shuō háishì bù shuō, jiéguǒ dōu yīyàng.</rt></ruby><br>Whether you speak up or not, the result will be the same.<br><hr><br>- 无论如何 (wúlùn rúhé) is a useful set phrase, meaning 'no matter what.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG6ZI8L		{}

Noun 1 + 不比 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br>你不 比别人 笨 。		- Basic comparisons with 'bu bi'<br>- You might wonder why you have 不比 (bù bǐ) for negative comparisons when you already have没有 (méiyǒu) for comparisons. The answer is that they're not exactly the same thing! 没有 should be your 'go to word' for expressing 'not as... as...,' but there are cases where 不比 (in all of its subtle glory) is a better choice.<br>- 不比 and没有are not exactly the same.  没有 means 'not as... as,' whereas 不比 is a direct negation of比, meaning 'notmore... than.'  Compare the following two English sentences:<br>- You'd probably be more upset to hear the former from a friend than the latter.  The two above sentences in Chinese are:<br>- To say that something isnot more adjectiveas another, you can use 不比 (bù bǐ). No snickering, please. This is similar to, but not exactly the same ascomparing with 没有.<br>- Noun 1 + 不比 + Noun 2 + Adj.<br><ruby>你不 比我 差。<rt>Nǐ bùbǐ wǒ chà.</rt></ruby><br>You're no worse than me.<br><ruby>你不 比别人 笨 。<rt>Nǐ bùbǐ biérén bèn.</rt></ruby><br>You're not dumber than anyone else.<br><ruby>他 太太 的 工资不 比他 低 。<rt>Tā tàitai de gōngzī bùbǐ tā dī.</rt></ruby><br>His wife's salary is no lower than his is.<br><hr><br>- If it's more about thedegreeof an action, use this pattern below:<br>- A + 不比 + B + Verb + 得 + Adj.<br>- Note that 'Verb + 得' can also placed before 不比.<br><ruby>你不 比歌手 唱 得  差 。<rt>Nǐ bùbǐ gēshǒu chàng de chà.</rt></ruby><br>You sing no worse than the singer does.<br><ruby>他 算 得不 比计算机 慢 。<rt>Tā suàn de bùbǐ jìsuànjī màn.</rt></ruby><br>He calculates no slower than the computer.<br><ruby>她 跳 得不 比明星 差 。<rt>Tā tiào de bùbǐ míngxīng chà.</rt></ruby><br>She dances no worse than a star.<br><hr><br>- Note: don't confuse 不比 (bùbǐ) with 不必 (bùbì)!	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG8DVSO		{}
要 + Verb + 就 + Verb ……<br>要买就买 ，我们 快 关门 了 。		- Conditions with 'yao' and 'jiu'<br>- The 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ grammar structure can be used to express the same meaning as如果⋯⋯就However, 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ is more intense and resolute, similar to imperative sentences (command sentences). Therefore, 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ sentences typically do not have a subject, but they can have a topic. This grammar form is similar to the English 'If you want to (verb) just (verb)...'<br>- 要 + Verb + 就 + Verb ……<br>- Note that the verbs in this pattern are usually single-syllable verbs.<br><ruby>要走就走 ，我们 不 需要 你 。<rt>Yào zǒu jiù zǒu, wǒmen bù xūyào nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>If you want to leave, leave.

任何 + Noun + 都 / 也 ……<br>我 的 弟弟 特别 顽固，任何的 人 都 不 能 说服 他。		- Expressing 'any' with 'renhe'<br>- 任何 (rènhé) is a modifier that means 'any,' 'whichever,' or 'whatsoever.' It is also like the English phrases 'any and all' or 'no matter what.'<br>- This modifier usually does not use 的. It is often paired with 都 or 也.<br>- 任何 + Noun + 都 / 也 ……<br><ruby>你 到 派对 以后任何饮料 都 不要 喝。<rt>Nǐ dào pàiduì yǐhòu rènhé yǐnliào dōu bùyào hē.</rt></ruby><br>After you arrive at the party, don't drink anything.<br><ruby>这里 在 修 路，任何车 都 不 可以 通过。<rt>Zhèlǐ zài xiū lù, rènhé chē dōu bù kěyǐ tōngguò.</rt></ruby><br>The road is under repair.

既⋯⋯也 / 又⋯⋯<br>他 做 事情既快又好。		- Expressing 'both… and…' with 'ji...you'<br>- 既 (jì) can be used in conjunction with either 又 (yòu) or 也 (yě) to express that something is 'both A and B':<br>- 既 + A + 又 + B<br>- A and B can be adjectives, verbs or short phrases. Most of the time A and B will be of the same form. It often sounds better one both A and B are single syllables or both are two syllables.<br><ruby>这个 同事既积极又努力。<rt>Zhège tóngshì jì jījí yòu nǔlì.</rt></ruby><br>This colleague is both proactive and hard-working.<br><ruby>这 家 餐厅既便宜又好吃。<rt>Zhè jiā cāntīng jì piányi yòu hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>This restaurant is both cheap and delicious.<br><ruby>他 做 事情既快又好。<rt>Tā zuò shìqing jì kuài yòu hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>He does things both quickly and well.<br><hr><br>- The structure can also be formed with 也, but here it is used primarily for verbs or verb phrases:<br>- 既 + [Verb Phrase] ，也 + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>这里既是 你 的 家乡 ，也是 我 的 家乡。<rt>Zhèlǐ jì shì nǐ de jiāxiāng, yě shì wǒ de jiāxiāng.</rt></ruby><br>This is both your hometown and mine.<br><ruby>她既是 我 妈妈 ，也是 我 朋友。<rt>Tā jì shì wǒ māma, yě shì wǒ péngyou.</rt></ruby><br>She is both my mother and my friend.<br><ruby>要求 是 你既要 会 说 流利 的 中文 ，也要 会 说 流利 的 英文 。<rt>Yāoqiú shì nǐ jì yào huì shuō liúlì de Zhōngwén, yě yào huì shuō liúlì de Yīngwén.</rt></ruby><br>The requirement is that you need to speak both fluent Chinese and English.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGZRPCK		{}
Subj. + 少不了 + Noun / Verb Phrase<br>春节少不了吃 饺子。		- Expressing 'can't do without' with 'shaobuliao'<br>- In the phrase 少不了 (shǎobuliǎo), the word 少 represents 'being without.' So 少不了 means 'can't be without' or 'can't do without.' It is quite colloquial in usage.<br>- Subj. + 少不了 + Noun / Verb Phrase<br><ruby>每年 春节，少不了饺子 和 春晚 。<rt>Měi nián Chūnjié, shǎobuliǎo jiǎozi hé Chūnwǎn.</rt></ruby><br>Every Chinese New Year, it's gotta be dumplings and the Spring Festival Gala.<br><ruby>如果 回家 晚 了，少不了一 顿 骂。<rt>Rúguǒ huíjiā wǎn le, shǎobuliǎo yī dùn mà.</rt></ruby><br>If I get home late, there's no getting out of getting yelled at.<br><ruby>过 生日少不了吃 生日 蛋糕 。<rt>Guò shēngrì shǎobuliǎo chī shēngrì dàngāo.</rt></ruby><br>On someone's birthday we can't not eat birthday cake.<br><hr><br>- Sometimes the two things that 少不了 connects can be events, saying 'It's like A because B happened.'

It is often used together with 是.<br>- Situation / Result ，少不了 + 是 + Reason<br>- Note, however, that in this construction, the reasonfollows少不了.<br><ruby>看 他 的 样子，少不了是 跟 女 朋友 吵架 了。<rt>Kàn tā de yàngzi, shǎobuliǎo shì gēn nǚpéngyǒu chǎojià le.</rt></ruby><br>Look at him.

A, 等于 B<br>今天吃了炸鸡等于白跑步了。		- Expressing 'equal to' with 'dengyu'<br>- The word 等于 (děngyú) as in 'A 等于 B' is a mathematical term which, in everyday language, also expresses that A 'is equal to' or 'amounts to' B. However, scenario B is most likely not a scenario or situation that a person intentionally wanted or created for scenario A.<br>- A 等于 B<br><ruby>今天 吃 了 炸鸡 ，等于白 跑步 了。<rt>Jīntiān chī le zhájī, děngyú bái pǎobù le.</rt></ruby><br>I ate fried chicken today, which amounts to me going jogging for nothing.<br><ruby>你 告诉 小王 就等于把 秘密 告诉 了 大家。<rt>Nǐ gàosù Xiǎo Wáng jiù děngyú bǎ mìmì gàosù le dàjiā.</rt></ruby><br>Telling Xiao Wang your secret is equivalent to telling everyone your secret. <br><ruby>浪费 时间等于浪费 生命。<rt>Làngfèi shíjiān děngyú làngfèi shēngmìng.</rt></ruby><br>Wasting your time is wasting your life.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGB449A		{}
从 + noun + 中 + result<br>我从书中学习了很多知识。		- Expressing 'from' with 'cong... zhong'<br>- 从……中 (cóng... zhōng) is another way to express 'from,' and differs from the similar 从……到 (cóng... dào) which expresses 'from' in relation to time and place. 从……中 tells a source of information, and then tells what knowledge, information, or experience was gained from it.<br>- 从  + Source + 中 + Result<br>- The result is the knowledge, information, or experience gained from the 'source.'<br><ruby>我从书中学习 了 很 多 知识 。<rt>Wǒ cóng shū zhōng xuéxí le hěn duō zhīshi.</rt></ruby><br>I learned a lot from the book.<br><ruby>我们从聊天中知道 小王 不 喜欢 咖啡 。<rt>Wǒmen cóng liáotiān zhōng zhīdào Xiǎo Wáng bù xǐhuan kāfēi.</rt></ruby><br>We know from chatting that Xiao Wang doesn't like coffee. <br><ruby>从这 件 事中小王 明白 了 诚实 的 重要 。<rt>Cóng zhè jiàn shì zhōng Xiǎo Wáng míngbai le chéngshí de zhòngyào.</rt></ruby><br>Xiao Wang knows the importance of honesty from this matter.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGEB7F5		{}
Verb + 就 + Verb<br>走就走 ，我 早就 不 想 干 了 ！		- Expressing indifference with 'jiu'<br>- One of the many uses of 就 (jiù) is to add emphasis to indifference. This is similar to when we say in English 'if you want to do it, then just do it!' and swapping out the 'do' in that sentence for some other verb.<br>- If you've learned toexpress 'as one likes' with 就, then this pattern should feel familiar. It has a very different tone, however, better suited to higher-level learners.<br>- This structure will usually add emphasis to what are saying, and it often expresses that the speaker has an 'I don't care' attitude.<br>- Verb + 就 + Verb<br>- Note that the verb in this pattern is the same one repeating.<br><ruby>坏了就坏了 ，再 买 新的 。<rt>Huài le jiù huài le, zài mǎi xīn de.</rt></ruby><br>If it's broken, leave it there.

无 + Noun + 可 + Verb<br>我无话可说。		- Expressing 'no' (noun) 'to' (verb) with 'wu... ke...'<br>- This pattern is formal and has sort of a classical feel to it. It's a more condensed form of '没有 [Noun] 可以 [Verb].' 无 (wú) means 'to not have' (same as 没有), and  可 can stand in for 可以. This pattern is useful when you want to express that a person is unable to perform the verb because the noun/object is not present.<br>- 无 + Noun + 可 + Verb<br>- Sometimes the noun or the verb will have an archaic feel to it, like 处 (chù) for 'place,' or 归 (guī) for 'return to.'<br><ruby>我 和 他无话可说。<rt>Wǒ hé tā wú huà kě shuō.</rt></ruby><br>I had nothing to say to him.<br><ruby>公司 倒闭 了，小王 觉得 自己 现在无路可走。<rt>Gōngsī dǎobì le, Xiǎo Wáng juéde zìjǐ xiànzài wú lù kě zǒu.</rt></ruby><br>The company has gone bankrupt, and Xiao Wang feels that he has nowhere to go.<br><ruby>公司 需要 招聘 新人 了，我 现在无人可用。<rt>Gōngsī xūyào zhāopìn xīnrén le, wǒ xiànzài wú rén kě yòng.</rt></ruby><br>The company needs to recruit new people.

一 + Measure Word + (Noun) + 也 / 都 + 不 / 没 + Verb<br>一句 中文都不 会 说 。		- Expressing 'not even one'<br>- In English we might want to say something like 'I have absolutely no money, not even one penny.' Expressing that 'not even one' can take one of several forms, all of which are common in everyday Chinese.<br>- This structure is usually used for emphasizing how little of something there is.

The only difference is that this structure uses 甚至连 (shènzhì lián) to express 'not only..., but even.'<br>- Subj. + 不但 ⋯⋯ ，甚至连 + New Subject + 也 + Matching Situation<br><ruby>他不但不 知道 李连杰 ，甚至连成龙也不 知道 。<rt>Tā bùdàn bù zhīdào Lǐ Liánjié , shènzhì lián Chéng Lóng yě bù zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>Not only does he not know Jet Li, he doesn't even know Jackie Chan.<br><ruby>妹妹不但喜欢 榴莲 这样 味道 重 的，甚至连臭豆腐也喜欢。<rt>Mèimei bùdàn xǐhuan liúlián zhèyàng wèidào zhòng de, shènzhì lián chòu dòufu yě  xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>My sister not only likes durian, which has a strong flavor, but even stinky tofu too.<br><ruby>你 男朋友不但帮 你 做好 了 攻略 ，甚至连飞机票也帮 你 买好了 。<rt>Nǐ nánpéngyou bùdàn bāng nǐ zuò hǎo le gōnglüè, shènzhì lián fēijīpiào yě bāng nǐ mǎi hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>Your boyfriend not only helped you with your vacation planning, he even helped you buy your plane tickets.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGF9320		{}
Action ，好 + Purpose<br>她 睡前 常常 喝 牛奶 ，好入睡 。		- Expressing purpose with 'hao'<br>- 好 (hǎo) can mean 'in order to or 'for the sake of' when coming before a verb phrase, and therefore expresses the purpose. You might think of it as a more advanced version of the'easy to [verb]' 好.<br>- Action ，好 + Purpose<br><ruby>她 睡前 常常 喝 牛奶 ，好入睡 。<rt>Tā shuì qián chángcháng hē niúnǎi, hǎo rùshuì.</rt></ruby><br>She often drinks milk before bedtime to help her fall asleep.<br><ruby>老师 ，请 说 慢 点儿 ，我们好做 笔记 。<rt>Lǎoshī, qǐng shuō màn diǎnr, wǒmen hǎo zuò bǐjì.</rt></ruby><br>Teacher, you need to speak a little slower so that we can take notes.<br><ruby>请 把 车 停 到 里面 ，好让 别人 走路 。<rt>Qǐng bǎ chē tíng dào lǐmiàn, hǎo ràng biérén zǒulù.</rt></ruby><br>Please park the car inside so that other people can walk here.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG18JOA		{}
跟 / 和 + Topic + 有关的 + Noun<br>与他有关的事情，我都不想知道。		- Expressing 'related to...' with 'you guan de'<br>- When you need to express one thing in relation to another, the word 有关 (yǒuguān) can be a useful way of making a noun more specific. It comes in two flavors: the '跟……有关的' (gēn... yǒuguān de) structure, which is informal, and the  '与……有关的' (yǔ... yǒuguān de) structure, which is formal.<br>- The more casual form uses 跟 or 和. Use this in your spoken Mandarin.<br>- 跟 / 和 + Topic + 有关的 + Noun<br><ruby>我 和 他 分手了,跟他有关的事情 我 都 不 想 知道。<rt>Wǒ hé tā fēnshǒu le, gēn tā yǒuguān de shìqing wǒ dōu bù xiǎng zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>We broke up, I don't want to know anything related to him.<br><ruby>他 对 中国 很 感兴趣,跟中国有关的故事 他 都 很 感兴趣。<rt>Tā duì Zhōngguó hěn gǎn xìngqù, gēn Zhōngguó yǒuguān de gùshi tā dōu hěn gǎn xìngqù. </rt></ruby><br>He is very interested in China, he is interested in anything related to Chinese history. <br><ruby>和这个 项目有关的资料 都 需要 保密。<rt>hé zhège xiàngmù yǒuguān de zīliào dōu xūyào bǎomì.</rt></ruby><br>Any information related to this project needs to be kept confidential.<br><hr><br>- In more formal contexts, you will see the pattern used with 与 (yǔ).<br>- The more casual form is:<br>- 跟 / 和 + Topic + 有关的 + Noun<br><ruby>与游戏有关的活动，我 都 想 参加。<rt>Yú yóuxì yǒuguān de huódòng, wǒ dōu xiǎng cānjiā.</rt></ruby><br>I would like to participate in any activity related to the game.<br><ruby>他 为了 追 小丽，了解 了 很多与小丽有关的事情。<rt>Tā wèile zhuī Xiǎo lì, liǎojiě le hěn duō yú Xiǎo lì yǒuguān de shìqing.</rt></ruby><br>He has learned a lot of things about Xiao Li in order to chase her.<br><ruby>与恐龙有关的问题，你 都 可以 问 他，他 都 知道。<rt>Yú kǒnglóng yǒuguān de wèntí, nǐ dōu kěyǐ wèn tā, tā dōu zhīdào.</rt></ruby><br>You can ask him questions about dinosaurs, and he knows everything.<br><hr><br>- Finally, to negate 有关 in a formal context, use 无关 (wúguān):<br><ruby>与这 次 会议 主题无关的事情，我们 就 不 讨论 了。<rt>Yú zhè cì huìyì zhǔtí wúguān de shìqing, wǒmen jiù bù tǎolùn le.</rt></ruby><br>We will not discuss matters that are not relevant to the theme of this meeting.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGD19DA		{}

所谓 + (的) Noun Phrase<br>所谓“小意思” 就 是 指 礼物。		- Expressing 'so-called' with 'suowei'<br>- 所谓 (suǒwèi) is the Chinese way of expressing 'so-called.' It can also be used in scenarios you would use sarcastic air quotes. Just keep in mind that 'so-called' frequently comes with a negative attitude in English, but this is not always so in Chinese.<br>- 所谓 + (的) Noun Phrase<br>- The nouns phrase in this pattern is the 'so-called name' being called into question.

Subj.＋越＋Verb＋越 + Adj. / Verb<br>她越想越生气 。		- Expressing 'the more... the more...' with 'yue… yue…'<br>- More than 'putting stuff' after two instances of 越 (yuè) in a sentence, there are a number of very specific patterns you will notice if you want to get more sophisticated with 越 (yuè) and go beyond using the simpler越来越 (yuèláiyuè).<br>- Subj. + 越 ⋯⋯ ，越 ⋯⋯<br>- It's normally verbs or verb phrases following each 越, but adjectives are also possible (typically after the second 越).<br><ruby>我们越想越生气 。<rt>Wǒmen yuè xiǎng yuè shēngqì.</rt></ruby><br>The more we think about it, the angrier we get.<br><ruby>我越看越喜欢 。<rt>Wǒ yuè kàn yuè xǐhuan.</rt></ruby><br>The more I look at it, the more I like it.<br><hr><br>- Sometimes this pattern is best translated into English as 'more and more,' which is similar to越来越 (yuèláiyuè).<br>- What follows the first 越 is typically the reason why the second 越 phrase happens.<br>- Subj. 1 + 越 ⋯⋯ ，Subj. 2 + 越 ⋯⋯<br>- Again, it's normally verbs or verb phrases following each 越, but adjectives are also possible (typically after the second 越).<br><ruby>她越说 ，我越生气 。<rt>Tā yuè shuō, wǒ yuè shēngqì.</rt></ruby><br>The more she talks, the angrier I get.<br><ruby>你们越看 我 ，我越紧张 。<rt>Nǐmen yuè kàn wǒ, wǒ yuè jǐnzhāng.</rt></ruby><br>The more you look at me, the more nervous I am.<br><ruby>我越走 ，腿越痛 。<rt>Wǒ yuè zǒu, tuǐ yuè tòng.</rt></ruby><br>The more I walk, the more my legs hurt.<br><hr><br>- This is actually the same pattern as the last one, but its different English translation makes it worth paying attention to.<br>- 越 ⋯⋯ 越 + 不 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>你越让 孩子 学 ，孩子越不想 学 。<rt>Nǐ yuè ràng háizi xué, háizi yuè bù xiǎng xué.</rt></ruby><br>The more you push the kid to study, the less he wants to study.<br><ruby>他越问 ，我越不想 说。<rt>Tā yuè wèn, wǒ yuè bù xiǎng shuō.</rt></ruby><br>The more he asks, the less I want to tell him.<br><ruby>你越这样 说 ，他越不听 。<rt>Nǐ yuè zhèyàng shuō, tā yuè bù tīng.</rt></ruby><br>The more you talk this way, the less he listens.<br><hr><br>- This pattern involves the same verb repeated after each 越.

在 + Time + 内<br>你 必须在一周内完成。		- Expressing 'within' a period of time using 'zai... nei'<br>- Saying '在 (a period of time) 内' may sound a bit redundant, since 在 means 'in' and 内 means 'within' or 'inside,' but it is a commonly used 'sandwich pattern' which means 'within (a period of time).'<br>- 在 + (a period of time) + 内<br>- The period of time in this structure can be a clear-cut indicator of time (days, months, years) or it can be a more vague indicator of time (short amount of time, a lifetime, etc.).	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG5A494		{}
宁可⋯⋯，也⋯⋯<br>他宁可输，也不 放弃。		- Expressing 'would rather' with 'ningke'<br>- 宁可 (nìngkě) is used when the speaker wants to compare two unfavorable options, and choose one over the other. We usually express this as 'would rather... than...' in English.<br>- This construction puts 宁可 at the beginning of the sentence followed by 也不. 宁可 is followed by the less unfavorable option and 也不 is followed by the most unfavorable option.<br>- 宁可⋯⋯ ，也不⋯⋯<br><ruby>我宁可没有 男朋友 ，也 不要 随便 找 一 个 男朋友 。<rt>Wǒ nìngkě méiyǒu nán péngyǒu, yě bù yào suíbiàn zhǎo yī gè nánpéngyǒu.</rt></ruby><br>I'd rather have no boyfriend than find a random one.<br><ruby>我们宁可早到也 不要 迟到 。<rt>Wǒmen nìngkě zǎo dào yě bù yào chídào.</rt></ruby><br>We'd rather arrive early than late.<br><ruby>他宁可输 ，也 不放弃 。<rt>Tā nìngkě shū, yě bù fàngqì.</rt></ruby><br>He'd rather lose than give up.<br><hr><br>- In this construction 宁可 is used a little differently. 宁可 is followed by unfavorable actions while 也要 is followed by things that you desire or something that you intend to achieve.<br>- 宁可 ⋯⋯ ，也要 ⋯⋯<br>- Here the speaker must pay a price in order to complete or gain something, a bit like 'even though X, I'm still willing to do Y.'<br><ruby>我宁可熬夜也 要做完 。<rt>Wǒ nìngkě áoyè yě yào zuò wán.</rt></ruby><br>I'd rather stay up tonight just to finish it.<br><ruby>孩子们宁可不 吃饭 ，也 要多 玩 一会儿 。<rt>Háizimen nìngkě bù chīfàn, yě yào duō wán yīhuǐr.</rt></ruby><br>The kids would rather not eat just to play a little longer.<br><ruby>他宁可和 女朋友 分手 ，也 要留 在 国外 。<rt>Tā nìngkě hé nǚpéngyǒu fēnshǒu, yě yào liú zài guówài.</rt></ruby><br>He would rather break up with his girlfriend just to stay abroad.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGF3F2Y		{}

别说⋯⋯，就是⋯⋯<br>别说一百 ，就是一 块 钱 我 也 不 给 你 。		- Expressing 'let alone' with 'bie shuo'<br>- 别说 (bié shuō) means something like 'leaving aside' or 'don't think about,' and is used in the following way:<br>- 别说 + A ， 连  / 就是+ B + 也 / 都 + Verb<br>- This is similar to English where we might say: 'don't think about preparing a banquet, you can't even make instant noodles.' Note that this sentence structure is the reverse to the更不用说pattern.<br><ruby>别说一百，就是一 块 钱 我也不 给 你 。<rt>Bié shuō yībǎi, jiùshì yīkuài qián wǒ yě bù gěi nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>Don't think about one hundred, I won't even give you one kuai.<br><ruby>别说白酒，连啤酒 的 味道 我都受 不了。<rt>Bié shuō báijiǔ, lián píjiǔ de wèidào wǒ dōu shòubuliǎo.</rt></ruby><br>Don't even mention baijiu; I can't even stand the taste of beer.<br><ruby>别说英语， 你 说 中文 我也不 知道 怎么 回答。<rt>Bié shuō Yīngyǔ, nǐ shuō Zhōngwén wǒ yě bù zhīdào zěnme huídá.</rt></ruby><br>Forget about English!

⋯⋯，更不用说⋯⋯<br>她 会 说 法语 ，更 不用 说英语 了 。		- Expressing 'let alone' with 'geng buyong shuo'<br>- 更不用说 (gèng bùyòng shuō) is similar to the English expression 'let alone' or 'to say nothing of.' For example, we might say: 'he can't even boil an egg, let alone prepare a banquet.'<br>- 连 + A + 都 / 也 + Verb， 更不用说 + B + 了<br>- Notice that the order used in this pattern is the opposite of the别说structure.<br><ruby>连我都不 知道 这个 歌手，更不用说他 了。<rt>Lián wǒ dōu bù zhīdào zhège gēshǒu, gèng bùyòng shuō tā le.</rt></ruby><br>I don't even know the singer, let alone him.<br><ruby>连家人都不 理解 你，更不用说其他 的 人 了。<rt>Lián jiārén dōu bù lǐjiě nǐ, ggèng bùyòng shuō qítā de rén le.</rt></ruby><br>Even your family doesn't understand you, let alone other people.<br><ruby>连周末都要 加班，更不用说工作日 了。<rt>Lián zhōumò dōu yào jiābān, gèng bùyòng shuō gōngzuòrì le.</rt></ruby><br>I have to work overtime even on weekends, not to mention work days.<br><hr><br>- Some sentences will deviate from the structure a little bit, dropping the 连 or even both the 连 and the 都:<br><ruby>他都不 会 煮 鸡蛋，更不用说做 一 大 桌子 的 菜 了。<rt>Tā dōu bù huì zhǔ jīdàn, gèng bùyòng shuō zuò yī dà zhuōzi de cài le.</rt></ruby><br>He can't even boil an egg, let alone prepare a banquet.<br><ruby>他 从来 没有 出 过 远门，更不用说出国 了。<rt>Tā cónglái méiyǒu chū guo yuǎnmén, gèng bùyòng shuō chū guó le.</rt></ruby><br>He's never traveled very far, let alone out of the country.<br><hr><br>- Unless the first action is negated with 没有, 更不用说 generally sounds more natural followed by a 了.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGHOI8S		{}
不但 / 不只 / 不仅⋯⋯，而且 / 还 / 也 ⋯⋯<br>他不仅喜欢 吃 中国 菜，而且也会 做 几 个 中国 菜！		- Many types of 'not only... but also...'<br>- We've seen不但……而且 (bùdàn... érqiě)at the B1 level, but there are a number of other structures which can be used to express the same thing. 不但 can be substituted with 不仅 (bùjǐn) or 不只 (bùzhǐ), both meaning 'not only,' and can be followed by 而且 (érqiě), 还 (hái), or 也 (yě).

本来 vs 原来<br>他原来的 公司本来要 派 他 去 上海，但是 因为 家 里 有事，去 不了 了。		- Comparing 'benlai' and 'yuanlai'<br>- If something was originally a certain way, or 'should be' a certain way, the Chinese words used are often 本来 (běnlái) and 原来 (yuánlái). 本来 (běnlái) is usually an adverb while 原来 (yuánlái) could be either an adjective or an adverb.<br>- If something happened unexpectedly later, 本来 is preferred rather than 原来 considering there is a change of the original situation. 本来 means 'originally.' Since the action has already happened, the pattern 是⋯⋯的 is suggested here. 是 is optional.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 是 + [（不）要 / 会 / 应该 ] + Verb + 的，但是 / 可是⋯⋯<br><ruby>我本来是 要 去 参加 你的 生日 派对 的，可是 周末 突然 要 加班。<rt>Wǒ běnlái shì yào qù cānjiā nǐ de shēngrì pàiduì de, kěshì zhōumò tūrán yào jiābān.</rt></ruby><br>I was originally going to go to your birthday party, but I had to work some extra time this weekend.<br><ruby>他本来是 应该 考 得 更 好 的，可是 那天 他 生病 了。<rt>Tā běnlái shì yīnggāi kǎo de gèng hǎo de, kěshì nà tiān tā shēngbìng le.</rt></ruby><br>He would have done better on the test, but he was sick that day.<br><ruby>我们本来不 打算 去 的，后来 因为 他们 打 了 好 几 次 电话 就 去 了。<rt>Wǒmen běnlái bù dǎsuàn qù de, hòulái yīnwèi tāmen dǎ le hǎo jǐ cì diànhuà jiù qù le.</rt></ruby><br>We didn't plan to go, but we went in the end because they called us several times.<br><hr><br>- 本来 is used when something is common sense. There are certain expectations for the speaker and listener. Since there is no real English equivalent, it is best translated as 'it goes without saying.' It can also be translated to 'supposed to,' following it with a certain expectation.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就 + 很 / 不 + Adj.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就 + [ 会 / 要 / 得 / 应该 ] + Verb<br><ruby>生活本来就 很 不 容易。<rt>Shēnghuó běnlái jiù hěn bù róngyì.</rt></ruby><br>Life isn't supposed to be very easy.<br><ruby>搬家本来就 很 麻烦。<rt>Bānjiā běnlái jiù hěn máfan.</rt></ruby><br>Moving is supposed to be very troublesome.<br><ruby>照顾 孩子本来就 是 父母 的 责任。<rt>Zhàogù háizi běnlái jiùshì fùmǔ de zérèn.</rt></ruby><br>Taking care of children is supposed to be the responsibility of parents.<br><hr><br>- If you've got an opinion to express after stating how it 'should be' or 'should not be,' then 本来就 will help you sound more convincing. The end of the sentence usually has an imperative or rhetorical question that leads to an opinion or suggestion, emphasizing the tone.<br>- Subj. + 本来 + 就 ＋ ⋯⋯<br><ruby>你本来就 够 瘦 了 ，还要 减肥 吗？<rt>Nǐ běnlái jiù gòu shòu le, hái yào jiǎnféi ma?</rt></ruby><br>You are already thin enough and you still want to lose weight?<br><ruby>他 讲 得本来就 不 对，为什么 还 要 我 听 他 的？<rt>Tā jiǎng de běnlái jiù bùduì, wèishénme hái yào wǒ tīng tā de?</rt></ruby><br>What he said was wrong all along, so why do you still want me to listen to what he says?<br><ruby>他本来就 不 是 个 好 人，你 怎么 还要 帮他？<rt>Tā běnlái jiù bù shì gè hǎorén, nǐ zěnme hái yào bāng tā?</rt></ruby><br>He was never a good person.

才 vs 就<br>我 花 了 两 天才修 好 ，你 一下子就弄 坏 了。		- Comparing 'cai' and 'jiu'<br>- Both 才 (cái) and 就 (jiù) are adverbs that have to do with expressing time, and they are both placed before verbs. However, they typically have opposite effects on the tone of the sentence, with 才 (cái) implying a sense of lateness, and 就 (jiù) imparting a sense of earliness.<br>- 才 indicatesthat the speaker feels that the events discussed happened later than expected. Sometimes it also expresses anxiety, impatience, anger, or other related emotions.<br>- Subj. + Time Word + 才 + Verb<br><ruby>我 等 了 两 个 小时才买到 票。<rt>Wǒ děng le liǎng gè xiǎoshí cái mǎi dào piào.</rt></ruby><br>I waited two hours before I could buy the ticket.<br><ruby>老板 十一 点才到 办公室。<rt>Lǎobǎn shíyī diǎn cái dào bàngōngshì.</rt></ruby><br>The boss didn't come to the office until 11 o'clock.<br><ruby>这个 项目 最少 要 花 两 个 月才能 做 完。<rt>Zhège xiàngmù zuì shǎo yào huā liǎng gè yuè cái néng zuò wán.</rt></ruby><br>It's going to take at least two months to complete this project.<br><hr><br>- 才 can also mean 'only' in the sense of a small quantity.<br>- 才 ( + Verb) + Measure Word + Noun<br>- The key thing to pay attention to here is that the 才 goesbeforetheverb, and not the 'small quantity' that follows it.<br><ruby>我们 有 这么 多 人，你才点 了 三 个 菜。<rt>Wǒmen yǒu zhème duō rén, nǐ cái diǎn le sān gè cài.</rt></ruby><br>We have so many people and you only ordered three dishes.<br><ruby>我 买 了 这么 多 东西，才花 了 五 百 块 。<rt>Wǒ mǎi le zhème duō dōngxi, cái huā le wǔ bǎi kuài.</rt></ruby><br>I bought this many things, and I only spent 500 RMB.<br><hr><br>- When 才 is followed by a time, it can express the idea of 'only,' as in, 'it's only 9 o'clock,' expressing the idea that '9 o'clock is not late.' This would seem to be the opposite of the 才 expressing 'lateness,' but it's important to remember that this 才 precedes atime, and not anaction.<br>- (现在) + 才 + Time<br><ruby>现在才九点 ，再 玩 一会儿 。<rt>Xiànzài cái jiǔ diǎn, zài wán yīhuìr.</rt></ruby><br>It's only nine o'clock.

Why did you get up so early?<br><hr><br>- 就 indicatesthat something has occurred earlier than the speaker expected.

For this 'small quantity' emphasis, both 才 and 就 can be used before the verb to express essentially the same thing. (If you really want to split hairs, native speakers might say that there's a tiny difference in emphasis between the two, but that level of nuance goes beyond the scope of this grammar point.)<br>- Subj. + 就 + (＋Verb) ＋ Measure Word ＋ Noun<br><ruby>我们 有 这么 多 人，你就买 了 一 瓶 可乐？<rt>Wǒmen yǒu zhème duō rén, nǐ jiù mǎi le yī píng kělè?</rt></ruby><br>We have all these people, and you just bought that one bottle of cola?<br><ruby>你们 每天就睡 四 个 小时？<rt>Nǐmen měi tiān jiù shuì sì gè xiǎoshí?</rt></ruby><br>Do you only sleep four hours every day?<br><ruby>每 个 人 都 写 了 五页 纸，你就写 了 一 页 纸！<rt>Měi gè rén dōu xiě le wǔ yè zhǐ, nǐ jiù xiě le yī yè zhǐ!</rt></ruby><br>Everyone wrote five pages, but you wrote just one?<br><hr><br>- They're not matter and anti-matter; these two 'opposite' words can actually be used together. When used together, they're the 'just recently' meaning of 才 and the 'early' meaning of 就. Together, they indicate that one thingjust happened recently, and then the other happenedsoon after.<br>- Subj + 才 + Verb  + 就 + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>你才来就要 走 ？不 多 坐 一会儿 ？<rt>Nǐ cái lái jiù yào zǒu? bù duō zuò yīhuìr?</rt></ruby><br>You only just came and you‘re leaving already?

常常 vs. 往往<br>我不 常运动 ，我往往呆在 家里 。		- Comparing 'changchang' and 'wangwang'<br>- If something happens frequently, two useful words to describe this concept of 'often' in Chinese are 常常 (chángcháng) and 往往 (wǎngwǎng). However, they are used in different ways and different places, so this article will help you distinguish when and where to use them.<br>- 常常 simply means something happens frequently and not necessarily regularly, and is also not restricted to a certain precondition. 往往 is used in certain conditions to mean how things can be or are like, sort of like 'tend to.' It's a conclusion or judgment of a regular situation. 往往 has nothing to do with how often something happens. When using 往往, the sentence itself usually has a kind of condition of an occurring situation or behavior, for example, 商场往往周末的时候比较热闹。This is where 往往 differs from 常常. For the most part, you can translate 常常 as 'often,' where as you can translate 往往 as 'usually.' Also, 常常 can omit a 常, but you 往往 cannot omit a 往.<br><hr><br>- '常常' can be used in an imperative sentence expressing a suggestion. '往往' cannot be used in this kind of situation.<br><hr><br>- The negated version of '常常' is '不常'，expressing 'very rarely.' '往往' does not have a negated '不往往,' but can appear in negative sentences, mostly expressed as '往往不/没.' Also, '常常' can be used in question sentences, but '往往' cannot be.<br>- Subj. + 不常 + Verb<br>- Subj. + 往往 + 不 / 没 + Verb<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGE09B4		{}
再 vs 又<br>我不能再喝了，你走后我又喝了两瓶 。		- Comparing 'zai' and 'you'<br>- Both 再 (zài) and 又 (yòu) express the repeating of an action and can be roughly translated in English to 'again.'  However, 再 is used to express actions that have not yet occurred (the 'future again') and 又 is used for actions that have already occurred (the 'past again').  They're not interchangeable. In addition, each word has a few special usages.<br>- 再 is used to express something thathas already happened and will happen again.<br>- Subj. + 再 + Verb<br><ruby>我们 下次再来 吧。<rt>Wǒmen xiàcì zài lái ba.</rt></ruby><br>We will come here again next time.<br><ruby>我 想再看 一下。<rt>Wǒ xiǎng zài kàn yīxià.</rt></ruby><br>I want to take another look.<br><hr><br>- You need to use 再 for this usage; you can't use 又:<br>- Aside from expressing the repetition of an action,再 can also be used to express the equivalent of the English word 'another.'<br>- Subj. + 再 + Verb + Obj.<br>- Note that the 'Object' mentioned above is usually also going to have an 一 and ameasure wordin front of it.  You'll see that in the examples below.<br>- 再 can be used with 先 to express sequential order. (ex. Do this....and then this....) In some cases, 再 can appear by itself to simply mean 'and then.'  While this doesn't sound so easy to confuse with 又, it's actually quite common for intermediate learners to misunderstand this use of 再 as meaning 'again,' so it's definitely worth mentioning here.<br>- Subj. + (先) + Action 1 + 再 + Action 2<br>- 又 is used in declarative sentences and describes thesimple repetition of actions. This repeated action has already occurred once in the past.<br>- Subj. + 又 + Verb + 了<br>- 又 is sometimes used to express that something that has happened beforeis going to happenin the immediate future.  In this case, it usually appears with 要 (yào), 可以 (kěyǐ), 能 (néng), or 是 (shì).  This usage often expresses exasperation or impatience with something happeningyetagain, but sometimes it's more neutral, or even happy.<br>- Subj. + 又 + (Aux. +) Verb + Obj.<br><ruby>明天又是星期一 ！<rt>Míngtiān yòu shì Xīngqīyī!</rt></ruby><br>Tomorrow is Monday again.<br><ruby>明天又要 开会，真 烦 人 。<rt>Míngtiān yòu yào kāi huì, zhēn fán rén.</rt></ruby><br>We're having another meeting tomorrow.

总算 vs 终于<br>今天 的 会终于开 完 了！你总算来 了。		- Comparing 'zongsuan' and “zhongyu'<br>- Adverbsis 总算 (zǒngsuàn) and 终于 (zhōngyú) both can be translated as 'finally' or 'in the end,' but they subtly different in tone.<br>- Grammatically, 总算 and 终于 are used basically the same way. They are both adverbs, and they can be placed before the subject or after the subject. However, in comparison to 终于, 总算 is seldom usedbeforethe subject. In the simple sentences given below, however, they are fully interchangeable.<br>- Subj. + 总算 / 终于 + Verb<br><ruby>你总算来了 ！<rt>Nǐ zǒngsuàn lái le!</rt></ruby><br>You finally came!<br><ruby>我终于懂 了 。<rt>Wǒ zhōngyú dǒng le.</rt></ruby><br>I finally understood it.<br><ruby>雨总算停 了 。<rt>Yǔ zǒngsuàn tíng le.</rt></ruby><br>The rain finally stopped.<br><hr><br>- Both 总算 and 终于 express that an action hasfinallyhappened after a long wait, however 总算 implies that the speaker had a bit of an agonizing wait, and it has a heavier tone better suited to complaints.<br><ruby>谢天谢地，你总算来 了。<rt>Xiè tiān xiè dì, nǐ zǒngsuàn lái le.</rt></ruby><br>Thank God, you finally came.<br><ruby>总算没 迟到。<rt>Zǒngsuàn méi chídào.</rt></ruby><br>You finally didn't arrive late.<br><ruby>她 的 感冒总算好 了。<rt>Tā de gǎnmào zǒngsuàn hǎo le.</rt></ruby><br>She finally got over her cold.<br><hr><br>- 终于 is more formal than 总算 (in other words, 总算 is more for spoken Chinese), and it also has a more objective feel (meaning that the speaker isn't just being impatient and there was indeed a very long wait for this thing thatfinallyhappened).<br><ruby>你终于决定 了！<rt>Nǐ zhōngyú juédìng le!</rt></ruby><br>You finally decided!<br><ruby>终于要 放假 了，开心 吧？<rt>Zhōngyú yào fàngjià le, kāixīn ba?</rt></ruby><br>You're finally going on vacation.

跟 vs 对<br>那 个 帅哥 在对我 招手！那 你 要跟他 去 吗？		- Comparing 'gen' and 'dui'<br>- 跟 (gēn) and 对 (duì) sometimes seem like they mean the same thing, and at other times they seem to be different. You need to be aware which cases are which.<br>- When using the verb 说, 跟 and 对 can both be used in a similar sentence pattern. 跟 and 对 are both prepositions, and they both express one person speaking to another.<br>- Person A + 跟 / 对 + Person B 说<br><ruby>我跟她 说 了，但是 她 不 信。<rt>Wǒ gēn tā shuō le, dànshì tā bù xìn.</rt></ruby><br>I told her, but she didn't believe me.<br><ruby>我对她 说 了，但是 她 不 信。<rt>Wǒ duì tā shuō le, dànshì tā bù xìn.</rt></ruby><br>I told her, but she didn't believe me.<br><ruby>他对我 说 他 爱 我。<rt>Tā duì wǒ shuō tā ài wǒ.</rt></ruby><br>He told me he loved me.<br><hr><br>- 跟 and 对 can both be verbs, and they are often used with 着, however their meanings are different.<br>- Subj. + 跟 / 对 + Obj.<br>- 跟 can be a verb, and its simplest meaning is 'follow.'

Generally, these are nouns or pronouns (as with 和). 对 cannot function like this.<br>- Subj. 1 + 跟 + Subj. 2 + Verb-Obj.<br><ruby>你 要跟我 一起 去 吗？<rt>Nǐ yào gēn wǒ yīqǐ qù ma?</rt></ruby><br>Are you going to go with me?<br><ruby>鲜花跟巧克力 是 最好 的 礼物。<rt>Xiānhuā gēn qiǎokèlì shì zuì hǎo de lǐwù.</rt></ruby><br>Flowers and chocolate are the best gifts.<br><hr><br>- When 对 as a preposition, it points to a certain target, since it can mean 'facing' or 'toward.' 跟 can only be used this way with 说.<br>- Subj. 1 对 Subj. 2 + Verb<br><ruby>那 个 美女 正对我 笑 呢。<rt>Nàge měinǚ zhèng duì wǒ xiào ne.</rt></ruby><br>That pretty girl is laughing at me.<br><ruby>不 要对老板 发脾气， 不然 后果 很 严重。<rt>Bùyào duì lǎobǎn fā píqì, bùrán hòuguǒ hěn yánzhòng.</rt></ruby><br>Don't lose your temper with the boss, otherwise there will be serious consequences.<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC5Y86		{}
朝 vs 向 vs 往<br>往前 走 十 分 钟。向雷锋 同志 学习！他朝我 笑 了 笑。		- Comparing 'chao' 'xiang' and 'wang'<br>- All three of these, 朝 (cháo), 向 (xiàng), and 往 (wǎng) can be used to indicate direction or position. When these preposition phrases are used before a verb, the three have the same structure and their meaning is the same. Although they are often interchangeable, there are also cases when they are not.<br>- Just put one of the three before the direction and the verb!<br>- 向 / 朝 / 往 + Direction + Verb<br>- The three are interchangeable in these types of 'purely directional' usage.<br><ruby>从 这里向/朝/往北 走 两 百 米 就 到 了。<rt>Cóng zhèlǐ xiàng/ cháo/ wǎng běi zǒu liǎng bǎi mǐ jiù dào le.</rt></ruby><br>From here, go one hundred meters north, and you'll get there.<br><ruby>这 个 小 女孩向左 看看 又向右 看看 才 过 马路。<rt>Zhège xiǎo nǚhái xiàng zuǒ kànkan yòu xiàng yòu kànkan cái guò mǎlù.</rt></ruby><br>This little girl looked left and then looked right before crossing the street.<br><ruby>我 看见 他朝你们 家 去 了。<rt>Wǒ kànjiàn tā cháo nǐmen jiā qù le.</rt></ruby><br>I saw him going towards your house.<br><hr><br>- 向 and 往 can sometimes be placed after a verb, however not just any verb will do. Oft-used verbs are 开, 飞, 发, 运, 送, 寄, 带, 驶 etc. As you can see, these are words that imply some sort of motion. In addition, compared to 向, 往 is used more often with those verbs, because 往 indicates the destination while 向 merely expresses a direction,. 朝 is not used this way.<br>- Verb + 向 / 往 + Direction<br><ruby>这 趟 火车开往沈阳。<rt>Zhè tàng huǒchē kāiwǎng Shěnyáng.</rt></ruby><br>This train is heading towards Shenyang.<br><ruby>这 趟 航班飞往纽约。<rt>Zhè tàng hángbān fēiwǎng Niǔyuē.</rt></ruby><br>This plane is bound for New York.<br><ruby>一 辆 黑色 的 小 轿车 慢慢 地 从 东驶向西。<rt>Yī liàng hēisè de xiǎo jiàochē mànmàn de cóng dōng shǐxiàng xī.</rt></ruby><br>A small black sedan slowly drove from east to west.<br><hr><br>- When a concrete action has a specifictarget(not adestination), use 向 or 朝. 往 cannot be used this way.<br>- 向 / 朝 + Target + Concrete Verb<br><ruby>他向/朝我 笑 了 笑。<rt>Tā xiàng / cháo wǒ xiào le xiào.</rt></ruby><br>He chuckled at me.<br><ruby>我朝他 开 了 一 枪。<rt>Wǒ cháo tā kāi le yī qiāng.</rt></ruby><br>I took a shot at him.<br><ruby>他 已经向全体 员工 解释 过 了。<rt>Tā yǐjīng xiàng quántǐ yuángōng jiěshì guo le.</rt></ruby><br>He has already explained it to all the employees.<br><hr><br>- When a verb and or the target of the verb is abstract, you can only use 向 to indicate the target, and cannot use 朝.<br>- 向 + Target + Abstract Verb<br><ruby>他 是 优秀 员工，我们 都 要向他 学习。<rt>Tā shì yōuxiù yuángōng, wǒmen dōu yào xiàng tā xuéxí.</rt></ruby><br>He is an exemplary employee, we should all learn from him.<br><ruby>我们 要向环保 部门 要求 严查 工厂 排污。<rt>Wǒmen yào xiàng huánbǎo bùmén yāoqiú yán chá gōngchǎng páiwū.</rt></ruby><br>We are going to demand that the Environmental Safety Department closely inspect the factory's sewage.<br><hr><br><hr><br><ruby>A: 他往南 走 了 。<rt>A: Tā wǎng nán zǒu le.</rt></ruby><br>He walked south.<br><ruby>B: 笨蛋 ！ 你 怎么 让 他往南 走 呢 ？南边 很 危险 ！<rt>B: Bèndàn!

对 vs. 对于<br>我对她 很 了解 ，她 不 会 这么 做 的 。		- Comparing 'dui' and 'duiyu'<br>- 对 (duì) and 对于 (duìyú) can be confusing because they overlap quite a bit in usage, but they are not entirely interchangeable.<br>- When 对 and 对于 are used asprepositionsto modify a verb, they are basically the same. As a matter of fact, when used this way 对 is just the simplification of 对于! 对于 sounds a bit more formal.<br>- 对／对于 + Object + Verb<br>- In the following example sentences, 对 and 对于 are interchangeable.<br><ruby>对(于)这 种 事情，你 有 什么 看法？<rt>Duì(yú) zhè zhǒng shìqing, nǐ yǒu shénme kànfǎ?</rt></ruby><br>As for this kind of thing, what's your perspective?<br><ruby>我对(于)上海 从来 没 喜欢 过 也 没 讨厌 过。<rt>Wǒ duì(yú) Shànghǎi cónglái méi xǐhuan guo yě méi tǎoyàn guo.</rt></ruby><br>I've never liked or disliked Shanghai.<br><hr><br>- Both 对 and 对于 can be placed before or after the subject in a sentence. Unlike 对, however, 对于 cannot be placed after the adverb in the middle of a sentence.<br>- They can both go in the very front:<br><hr><br>- They can both go right after the subject:<br><hr><br>- Only one can go right before the predicate:<br><hr><br>- All of the above examples mean 'we are all interested in this problem.'<br>- When 对 is used as a verb, it expresses 'to face' or 'to point at,' and you will often see it in the form 对着. It can also be used in verb phrases which refer to 'matching,' like 对上 and 对不上.<br>- Subj. + 对着 ／ 对上 ／ 对不上<br><ruby>枪口 不 要对 着人。<rt>Qiāng kǒu bùyào duìzhe rén.</rt></ruby><br>Don't point the gun at people.<br><ruby>我 喜欢对 着镜子 笑。<rt>Wǒ xǐhuan duìzhe jìngzi xiào.</rt></ruby><br>I like to laugh at the mirror.<br><ruby>这 两 个 数字对 上了 吗？<rt>Zhè liǎng gè shùzì duì shàng le ma? </rt></ruby><br>Did the two numbers match up?<br><hr><br>- To indicate to whom an emotional response is directed, you can use 对 but not 对于.<br>- A + 对 + B + Adj.<br><ruby>他对工作 很 认真。<rt>Tā duì gōngzuò hěn rènzhēn.</rt></ruby><br>He treats his work very seriously.<br><ruby>我 的 男 朋友对我 很 好。<rt>Wǒ de nán péngyǒu duì wǒ hěn hǎo.</rt></ruby><br>My boyfriend is very good to me.<br><hr><br><hr><br><ruby>A:对于这 件 事，你 怎么 看？<rt>A: Duìyú zhè jiàn shì, nǐ zěnme kàn?</rt></ruby><br>What do you think about this?<br><ruby>B: 我对她 很 了解，她 不 会 这么 做 的。<rt>B: Wǒ duì tā hěn liǎojiě, tā bù huì zhème zuò de.</rt></ruby><br>I understand her completely.

关于 vs 对于 vs 至于<br>关于放假，对于怎么解决，至于另外一份工作 。		- Comparing 'duiyu' and 'zhiyu'<br>- The differences between 对于 (duìyú) and 至于 (zhìyú) can be confusing. They both have similar meanings like 'concerning,' 'regarding' or 'as for,' and differences are subtle.<br>- 对于 usually emphasizes the thing that it is pointing to. Usually where you use 对 you can also use 对于.<br>- As an adverb or adverbial clause, you can place 对于 before or after the subject. It cannot be an attributive modifier (coming before a noun).<br>- Subj. + 对于 + Object + Predicate<br>- 对于 + Object， Subj. + Predicate<br><ruby>对于电脑 ，我 什么 都 不 懂。<rt>Duìyú diànnǎo, wǒ shénme dōu bù dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>With regards to computers, I don't understand anything.<br><ruby>我对于电脑 什么 都 不 懂。<rt>Wǒ duìyú diànnǎo shénme dōu bù dǒng.</rt></ruby><br>I don't understand anything about computers.<br><ruby>对于这 种 人，就 不 该 跟 他们 讲 道理。<rt>Duìyú zhè zhǒng rén, jiù bù gāi gēn tāmen jiǎng dàolǐ.</rt></ruby><br>With this kind of person, you shouldn't try to reason with them.<br><hr><br>- Note that tochangea topic, there needs to be another topic first. So youdon'tuse 至于 to start an entirely new discussion free of any existing topic.<br>- As a preposition, 至于 points to another topic, serving to change the subject of conversation.<br>- 至于 + Topic，Subj. + Verb Phrase<br><ruby>我们 要 开始 这 个 项目 了，至于什么 时候 开始，还 没 定。<rt>Wǒmen yào kāishǐ zhège xiàngmù le, zhìyú shénme shíhou kāishǐ, hái méi dìng.</rt></ruby><br>We're going to start this project, but as for when to start, we still haven't decided.<br><ruby>至于这 个 问题，我们 还 需要 进一步 讨论。<rt>Zhìyú zhège wèntí, wǒmen hái xūyào jìnyībù tǎolùn.</rt></ruby><br>As for this issue, we still need further discussion.<br><hr><br>- As an adverb, it expresses 'having reached a certain degree.' After it you can add words or phrases that describe degree. You can also say 至于 by itself or use 不至于.<br>- （不）至于 + Degree<br><hr>	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC01S0		{}
给 vs. 为<br>为你 准备 的 礼物		- Comparing 'gei' and 'wei'<br>- Both 给 and 为 can mean 'for.' They seem to be arbitrarily assigned to different verbs, and to make matters worse, some verbs (but not all!) can use either one. There are a few principles you can use to keep them straight, but also a few exceptions you need to memorize. As always, lots of examples help!<br>- As you know, 给 is also a verb meaning 'to give.' As such, 给 is often used with verbs to express an action done out of kindness or friendship. Think of all the things a mother does for a child, or a generous friend does for her bestie. These would use 给.<br>- Subj. + 给 + Recipient + [Verb Phrase]<br><ruby>请给我拿一双 筷子。<rt>Qǐng gěi wǒ ná yī shuāng kuàizi.</rt></ruby><br>Please get me a pair of chopsticks.<br><ruby>下 飞机 以后，我给你打电话。<rt>Xià fēijī yǐhòu, wǒ gěi nǐ dǎ diànhuà.</rt></ruby><br>After getting off the plane, I'll give you a call.<br><ruby>你 别 忘 了给我回邮件。<rt>Nǐ bié wàng le gěi wǒ huí yóujiàn.</rt></ruby><br>Don't forget to reply to my email.<br><hr><br>- The word 为 automatically feels more formal than 给, due to its association with classical Chinese. Besides being more formal, it is also often associated with obligatory actions or responsibilities. The typical example of this is 'to work for Company A': 为A公司工作.<br>- One other common usage of 为 is for uncontrollable emotional reactions that result from relationships with other people. These reactions aren't really done out of kindness; they're spontaneous and not a result of a conscious choice.<br>- 为 + Person + Verb / Adj.<br><ruby>我 现在为谷歌 公司工作。<rt>Wǒ xiànzài wèi Gǔgē gōngsī gōngzuò.</rt></ruby><br>I currently work for Google.<br><ruby>你为国家做过 贡献 吗 ？<rt>Nǐ wèi guójiā zuò guò gòngxiàn ma?</rt></ruby><br>Have you made a contribution to our country?<br><ruby>我 真的为你高兴。<rt>Wǒ zhēnde wèi nǐ gāoxìng.</rt></ruby><br>I'm truly happy for you.<br><hr><br>- The examples below should help you establish a bit of a feeling regarding the difference between 给and 为. You can see that the ones at the top feel more like something especially done for one person, whereas the ones at the end feel more like duty or obligation. The double yeses in the middle could be either, depending on context.	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASG863DE		{}
关于 vs 对于<br>对于那 个 人，关于我们 的 学习 方法		- Comparing 'guanyu' and 'duiyu'<br>- 关于 (guānyú) and 对于 (duìyú) seem similar, since both of these prepositions are used to point to specific people or things. However, when taking a closer look, the things they discuss and the angles they take are different.<br>- 对于 points to an object beingspecificallyreferred to, and usually the speaker has adopted a certain attitude or has come to some kind of conclusion about the person or object.<br><ruby>对于那 个 人 我 并 不 了解。<rt>Duìyú nàge rén wǒ bìng bù liǎojiě.</rt></ruby><br>As for that person, I just don't know him very well at all.<br><ruby>对于我们 的 工作 表现，老板 很 满意。<rt>Duìyú wǒmen de gōngzuò biǎoxiàn, lǎobǎn hěn mǎnyì.</rt></ruby><br>The boss is very satisfied with our work performance.<br><ruby>对于这 件 事情 他 没什么 看法。<rt>Duìyú zhè jiàn shìqing tā méi shénme kànfǎ.</rt></ruby><br>He doesn't really have any opinion about this matter.<br><hr><br>- 关于 names a topic, and often emphasizes arange, then introduces a comment related to it.<br><ruby>他 昨天 发表 了 一个关于中国 经济 的 演讲。<rt>Tā zuótiān fābiǎo le yī gè guānyú Zhōngguó jīngjì de yǎnjiǎng.</rt></ruby><br>Yesterday he made a speech about the Chinese economy.<br><ruby>我 需要 写 一 篇关于中美 文化 差异 的 文章。<rt>Wǒ xūyào xiě yī piān guānyú Zhōng-Měi wénhuà chāyì de wénzhāng.</rt></ruby><br>I need to write an article about the differences between Chinese and American culture.<br><ruby>关于你 辞职 的 申请，公司 还 在 考虑。<rt>Guānyú nǐ cízhí de shēnqǐng, gōngsī hái zài kǎolǜ.</rt></ruby><br>With regards to your application for resignation, the company is still considering it.<br><hr><br>- 关于 (guānyú) can also be used in the title of an article.<br><ruby>关于部门 调整 和 人事 安排<rt>Guānyú Bùmén Tiáozhěng hé Rénshì Ānpái</rt></ruby><br>'Regarding Department Adjustments and Human Affairs'<br><ruby>关于新年 放假 的通知<rt>Guānyú Xīnnián Fàngjià de Tōngzhī</rt></ruby><br>A Notification Regarding New Year Holidays<br><hr><br>- When the point emphasized is pretty clear (whether it be a range or a specific thing), then you can use either.<br><ruby>关于这 份 决议 ，大家 还 有 什么 补充 吗 ？<rt>Guānyú zhè fèn juéyì, dàjiā hái yǒu shénme bǔchōng ma?</rt></ruby><br>Is there anything that anyone wants to add to this decision?<br><ruby>对于这个 问题 ，你们 还 有 什么 意见 ？<rt>Duìyú zhège wèntí, nǐmen hái yǒu shénme yìjiàn?</rt></ruby><br>As for this issue, what other thoughts do you all have?<br><hr><br><ruby>A: 我们 今天 的 会议 内容 是 讨论 一下关于开发 中国 市场 的 问题。<rt>A: Wǒmen jīntiān de huìyì nèiróng shì tǎolùn yīxià guānyú kāifā Zhōngguó shìchǎng de wèntí.</rt></ruby><br>The content of today's meeting is a discussion about the problems in developing China's markets.<br><ruby>B: 我 的 意见 是对于中国 市场 我们 还 不 了解，最好 再 等等。<rt>B: Wǒ de yìjiàn shì duìyú Zhōngguó shìchǎng wǒmen hái bù liǎojiě, zuìhǎo zài děng děng.</rt></ruby><br>My opinion towards the Chinese markets is that we still don't understand.

适合 vs 合适<br>这 个 颜色 不适合他 ， 黑色 才 是 最合适的。		- Comparing 'shihe' and 'heshi'<br>- Mixing up the order of the two syllables in a word is something most learners do. This makes the pair 适合 (shìhé) and 合适 (héshì) annoying, to say the least. They mean more or less the same thing, but the former is a verb, while the latter is an adjective.<br>- 适合 is a verb meaning 'to suit,' and should take an object.<br>- Subj. + 适合 + Obj.<br>- 合适 is an adjective meaning 'suitable' or 'appropriate,' and is used in the same way as other adjectives.<br>- Subj. + Adv. + 合适<br><ruby>在 办公室 里 抽烟 有 点 不合适吧。<rt>Zài bàngōngshì lǐ chōuyān yǒudiǎn bù héshì ba.</rt></ruby><br>Inside the office, it's not really appropriate to smoke, right?<br><ruby>他 就是 最合适的，他 完全 符合 我们 的 招聘 要求。<rt>Tā jiùshì zuì héshì de, tā wánquán fúhé wǒmen de zhāopìn yāoqiú.</rt></ruby><br>He is just the most suitable.

平时 vs. 平常<br>你平时/平常做饭 吗 ？		- Comparing 'pingshi' and 'pingchang'<br>- 平时 (píngshí) and 平常 (píngcháng) look very similar (after all, they do start with 平), and they have similar meanings of 'often' or 'usually,' but they have slightly different uses.<br>- Both 平时 and 平常 can be used as adverbs.

以后 vs. 之后<br>我 昨天 吃完以后去 了 超市 。之后 我 就 回家 了 。		- Comparing 'yihou' and 'zhihou'<br>- Both '以后' (yǐhòu) or '之后' (zhīhòu) mean 'after,' but there are a few tiny differences in usage.<br>- Both can indicate another event happenedafteraspecific time.<br>- Subj. + Specified Time + 以后／之后 + Verb<br>- In situations something happens aftersomething else, you can use 以后. The stipulation with this is that 'afterWHAT' needs to be explicitly stated. That is, there has to be a 'specified time' for 以后 to modify. Otherwise 以后 won't work in those sentences.<br>- 以后 and 之后 may be freely interchanged in any of the below sentences.<br><ruby>下 过 雨以后空气 会 好 很 多 。<rt>Xià guo yǔ yǐhòu kōngqì huì hǎo hěn duō.</rt></ruby><br>After it rains, the air will be a lot better.<br><ruby>结婚之后他们 有 了 两 个 宝宝 。<rt>Jiéhūn zhīhòu tāmen yǒu le liǎng gè bǎobao.</rt></ruby><br>After getting married, they had two babies.<br><ruby>等 我 涨 工资以后请 你 吃饭 。<rt>Děng wǒ zhǎng gōngzī  yǐhòu qǐng nǐ chīfàn.</rt></ruby><br>After I get a raise, I will treat take you out to eat.<br><hr><br>- The key to understanding 以后 here is that if it doesn't comeimmediately aftersomething else, then it's being usedby itself. And when 以后 is used by itself, it doesn't mean'after;'it means'in the future.'<br>- 以后 ，⋯⋯<br><ruby>以后再 也 不 来 这里 吃饭 了 ， 又 贵 又 难吃 。<rt>Yǐhòu zài yě bù lái zhèlǐ chīfàn le, yòu guì yòu nánchī.</rt></ruby><br>In the future I will never come to this place to eat again.

Not only can it be used just like 以后,modifying the time, but it can also appear independently, meaning something along the lines of 'after that.' While 以后 must come after a specific time to mean 'after,' it cannot can stand by itself like this.<br>- (Event 1 ，) 之后 + Event 2<br><ruby>我 要 先 回家 把 东西 放 下 ，之后去 咖啡店 找 你 。<rt>Wǒ yào xiān huí jiā bǎ dōngxi fàng xià, zhīhòu qù kāfēidiàn zhǎo nǐ.</rt></ruby><br>I'm going to go home and drop my stuff off first, after that go to the cafe to look for you.<br><ruby>去年 夏天 他 来 过 我 家 ，之后再 也 没 见 过 他 。<rt>Qùnián xiàtiān tā lái guò wǒ jiā, zhīhòu zài yě méi jiàn guo tā.</rt></ruby><br>Last summer, he came to my house. After that, I haven't seen him.<br><hr><br>- In the following sentences, 以后 is not grammatical when it's not directly coupled with a time or event telling youafter what. 之后 can be used here to mean 'after that.'	https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/ASGC3SCN		{}
以后 vs. 然后 vs. 后来<br>我以后想 开 公司 。/后来他 去 了 美国 ，然后他 的 父母 也 搬 过去 了 。		- Comparing 'yihou' 'ranhou' 'houlai'<br>- While both 以后 (yǐhòu) and 后来 (hòulái) can mean 'later,' they have distinct uses. 然后 (ránhòu) means 'and then.' Don't let yet another 后 word confuse you!<br>- 然后 is a conjunction, which is always used in the middle of a sequence of events. It is often used with 先 (xiān, meaning 'first').

Whereas 看起来 indicates an appraisal of a physical situation, 看来 expresses a user's understanding of a situation.<br>- 看起来 is used to describe physical appearances. In other words, one can use 看起来 to literally describe what something 'lookslike.'<br>- Subj. + 看起来 ⋯⋯<br><ruby>女儿 今天看起来很 开心 。<rt>Nǚér jīntiān kànqǐlái hěn kāixīn.</rt></ruby><br>Our daughter looks really happy today.<br><ruby>这 道 菜看起来很 好吃。<rt>Zhè dào cài kànqǐlái hěn hǎochī.</rt></ruby><br>This dish looks really tasty.<br><ruby>这 两 件 衣服看起来差不多 一样 。<rt>Zhè liǎng jiàn yīfu kànqǐlái chàbuduō yīyàng.</rt></ruby><br>These two pieces of clothing look pretty much the same.<br><hr><br>- 看起来 can also be used to express how something 'looks like' something else.
